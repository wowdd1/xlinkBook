The course is divided into two halves. The first half covers computational molecular biology and genomics. It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. The second half covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homework requiring modification of scripts to perform computational analyses. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, and neuron behavior. The imaging component includes the basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models. The course is taught under two different numbers.  The lectures are the same for both but recitations and examinations are separate. 02-250 is intended primarily for computational biology, computer science, statistics or engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had prior experience with computer science or programming. 03-250 is intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors who have had limited prior experience with computer science or programming.

Extracting biological understanding from both large and small data sets now requires the use and design of novel algorithms, developed in the field of computational biology.

Students will learn fundamental algorithmic and machine learning techniques that are used in modern biological investigations, including algorithms to process string, graph, and image data. They will use these techniques to answer questions such as How do we reconstruct the sequence of a genome?, How do we infer evolutionary relationships among many species?, and How can we predict each genes biological role? on biological data. Previous exposure to molecular biology is not required, as the instructors will provide introductory materials as needed.

CB02318 | Introduction to Computational Medicine | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=02318&SEMESTER=S20 | instructors:Langmead, Christopher description:This course is an introduction to computational methods relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. It is the microcourse version of 02-518, Computational Medicine.

CB02331 | Modeling Evolution | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=02331&SEMESTER=S20 | instructors:Carja, Oana prereq:(15112) and (21241) and (15259 or 36218 or 36225 or 21325) description:Some of the most serious public health problems we face today, from drug-resistant bacteria, to cancer, all arise from a fundamental property of living systems -- their ability to evolve. Since Darwins theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.

Robots dramatically increase the reproducibility of scientific experiments, and are often cheaper and faster than humans, but are most often used to execute brute-force sweeps over experimental conditions. The result is that many experiments are wasted on conditions where the effect could have been predicted. Thus, there is a need for computational techniques capable of selecting the most informative experiments.  This course will introduce students to techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for automatically selecting experiments to accelerate the pace of discovery and to reduce the overall cost of research. Real-world applications from Biology, Bioengineering, and Medicine will be studied. Grading will be based on homeworks and two exams.

In this laboratory course, students will learn about various automatable experimental methods, design of experiments, hardware for preparing samples and executing automated experiments, and software for controlling that hardware. These topics will be taught in lectures as well as through laboratory experience using multi-purpose laboratory robotics. During weekly laboratory time, students will complete and integrate parts of two larger projects. The first project will be focused on liquid handling, plate control, plate reading, and remote control of the automated system based on experimental data.
