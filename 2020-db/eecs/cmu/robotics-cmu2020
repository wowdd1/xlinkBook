ROB16161 | ROB Freshman Seminar: Artificial Intelligence and Humanity | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16161&SEMESTER=F19 | instructors:Keating-Miller, JenniferNourbakhsh, Illah description:In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.  As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.

We investigate the ways in which visual art to literature to theatrical performance explores and interrogates societal conflict and emergence from conflict, and how evolving technological systems influence political power dynamics and modes of artistic practice.   We will use the legacy of societal conflict in Ireland and Northern Ireland to compare concepts and physical manifestations of borders, barriers and bridges in the region and in global contexts. We will examine fluctuating development of democratic processes in Ireland and Northern Ireland, individual and group public performance, and the influence of technologically crude and highly sophisticated tools on communities emerging from strife. We will use our analytical lens to focus on figurative and literal borders, barriers and bridges to explore work produced in Belfast, Derry and Dublin, alongside circumstances and artistic practice in present-day Pittsburgh, Cuidad Juarez, Jerusalem and Soweto.   On a visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland over spring break, students will meet with artists, writers, legislators, community organizers, academics and ex-combatants, to learn about their past experience and current motivations. Students will analyze artistic practice, peacekeeping initiatives and performance of identity in relation to the historical framework from which it emerges in Ireland and Northern Ireland. We will use this foundation as a point of comparison to practices throughout the world. Students will process their experience and developing analytical skills by documenting their responses through original creative work.

Systems Engineering is a formal discipline that guides a product from conception and design all the way to production, marketing, servicing, and disposal. The higher the complexity of the system, the more its creators benefit from applying formal processes such as Systems Engineering to its development. Topics in Systems Engineering covered in this course include needs and objectives analysis, requirements elicitation and formalization, system architecture development, trade studies, verification and validation, structured methodologies, etc. In the second part of this course we study key concepts of Project Management that must be performed along with Systems Engineering to achieve a successful project and product in a finite time period. For the Project Management portion of the course we cover topics such as work breakdown structures, scheduling, estimation, risk management, and agile methods.  This course is for MRSD students, and they will apply the concepts and methods they learn in this course to the MRSD Project Course I and II, thus giving them the opportunity to put the theory in practice in a requirements-driven robotic system development.

The explosion in robotics investment in the past 5 years presents many new opportunities and challenges to potential entrepreneurs who are interested in starting their own company.    In this class, you will take an idea, based on a subset of your MRSD project, and view it through the lens of product and/or service development. This includes the concept of a minimum viable product - what is the simplest version of your idea that can be sold, to test the marketplace? To get to this point, however, we will learn about the core fundamentals that go into the decision of what kind of business to build: innovation, business models, marketing, financial analysis, funding options, and exit strategies. In addition, we will spend a lot of time discussing practical strategies and considerations for companies in the robotics space.    This course will not teach you everything you need to know to build and run a company. Cant do that in one semester. But you will be exposed to all aspects of company formation and management, with an emphasis on what you need to know to have a potentially successful robotics business.    Along the way, we will make heavy use of the business model canvas concept, which is a relatively new approach to brainstorming and specifying the specifics of a business model - activities, partners, resources, value proposition, customer relationships, customer segments, distribution channels, cost structure, revenue streams, and risks. We will use this concept heavily throughout the course, and constantly come back to your canvas and update it throughout the semester. Once this is completed, developing a pitch deck becomes much easier.

The fundamentals of computational medical image analysis will be explored, leading to current research in applying geometry and statistics to segmentation, registration, visualization, and image understanding.  Additional and related covered topics include de-noising/restoration, morphology, level sets, and shape/feature analysis.  Students will develop practical experience through projects using the latest version of the National Library of Medicine Insight Toolkit ( ITK ) and SimpleITK, a popular open-source software library developed by a consortium of institutions including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. In addition to image analysis, the course will include interaction with radiologists and pathologist(s). *** Lectures are at CMU and students will visit clinicians at UPMC.  Some or all of the class lectures may also be videoed for public distribution, but students may request to be excluded from distributed video. 16-725 is a graduate class, and 16-425 is a cross-listed undergraduate section.  16-425 is new this year, and has substantially reduced requirements for the final project and for the larger homework assignments, nor does it require shadowing the clinicians. Prerequisites:  Knowledge of vector calculus, basic probability, and either C++ or python, including basic command-line familiarity and how to pass arguments to your own command-line programs.  Extensive expertise with C++ and templates is not necessary, but some students may find it helpful.
ROB16730 | Robotics Business | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16730&SEMESTER=S20 | instructors:Bourne, David description:This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars.  The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel -- extracted from the big plan-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.  These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.  Each student will either build their own business concept,  or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business.  Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.  In addition, he is the President of his own company Design One Software.

We will explore ways to represent  policies including hand-designed parametric functions, basis  functions, tables, and trajectory libraries. We will also explore  algorithms to create policies including parameter optimization and  trajectory optimization (first and second order gradient methods,  sequential quadratic programming, random search methods, evolutionary  algorithms, etc.).

ROB16748 | Underactuated Robots | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16748&SEMESTER=F19 | instructors:Travers, Matthew description:People and animals move through and interact with the world in a fundamentally dynamic way. In the vast majority of cases the same cannot be said for robots. In fact, many conventional approaches to motion planning and robot control attempt to explicitly cancel out the dynamics associated with different tasks. This class will consider underactuated robots, systems that do not have full control over their state and therefore cannot be planned for or controlled via conventional methods. Our goal will be to make novel locomoting robots act more naturally. This class will highlight the relationship between conventional ideas from deterministic motion planning and control design (e.g., dynamic programming and linear-quadratic regulators) and their contemporary counterparts, many of which help form the analytical basis for the probabilisitic reasoning that underlies contemporary AI systems (e.g., POMDPs). Note that this course is inspired by and, for the most part, will follow the format of Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines created by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT. We will take several tangents, but the course materials provided by Prof. Tedrake through MIT Open Courseware are an incredible resource for this course (and really just in general).

Insects can perform different tasks, such as manipulation or locomotion, with their small scale bodies varying from 200m to 16cm length. Similarly, we can define a micro-robotic system as an autonomous or semi-autonomous device with features on the micron scale or that make use of micron-scale physics for mobility or manipulation of objects. Due to their small size scales, microrobots will encounter difficulties unlike their macro-scale counterparts, in terms of fabrication and autonomy. In this project-based course, our aim will be on learning the physics of scaling, fabrication paradigms, actuation and sensing strategies, with numerous case studies, and to build an insect-inspired robotic system.

It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot, but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the autonomy. For example, robots should be safe to human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly; autonomous vehicles should be safe to other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct functioning of all system components, i.e., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control. This course deals with both the design and the verification of safe robotic systems. From the design perspective, we will talk about how to assure safety through planning, prediction, learning, and control. From the verification perspective, we will talk about verification of deep neural networks, safety or reachability analysis for closed loop systems, and analysis of multi-agent systems.
