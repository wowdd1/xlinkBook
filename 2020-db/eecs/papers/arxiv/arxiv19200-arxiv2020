arxiv-1606-08425 | Predicting the Relative Difficulty of Single Sentences With and Without Surrounding Context | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08425 | id:1606.08425 author:Elliot Schumacher, Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Gwen Frishkoff, Maxine Eskenazi category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-27 summary:The problem of accurately predicting relative reading difficulty across a set of sentences arises in a number of important natural language applications, such as finding and curating effective usage examples for intelligent language tutoring systems. Yet while significant research has explored document- and passage-level reading difficulty, the special challenges involved in assessing aspects of readability for single sentences have received much less attention, particularly when considering the role of surrounding passages. We introduce and evaluate a novel approach for estimating the relative reading difficulty of a set of sentences, with and without surrounding context. Using different sets of lexical and grammatical features, we explore models for predicting pairwise relative difficulty using logistic regression, and examine rankings generated by aggregating pairwise difficulty labels using a Bayesian rating system to form a final ranking. We also compare rankings derived for sentences assessed with and without context, and find that contextual features can help predict differences in relative difficulty judgments across these two conditions. version:1

The GELU nonlinearity is the expected transformation of a stochastic process which randomly applies the identity or zero map, combining the intuitions of dropout and zoneout while respecting neuron values. This connection suggests a new probabilistic understanding of nonlinearities. We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all tasks. version:1
arxiv-1606-08390 | Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08390 | id:1606.08390 author:Allan Jabri, Armand Joulin, Laurens van der Maaten category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-27 summary:Visual question answering (VQA) is an interesting learning setting for evaluating the abilities and shortcomings of current systems for image understanding. Many of the recently proposed VQA systems include attention or memory mechanisms designed to perform "reasoning". Furthermore, for the task of multiple-choice VQA, nearly all of these systems train a multi-class classifier on image and question features to predict the answers. This paper questions the value of these common practices and develops a simple alternative model based on binary classification. Instead of treating answers as competing choices, our model receives the answer as input and predicts whether or not an image-question-answer triplet is correct. We evaluate our model on the Visual7W Telling and the VQA Real Multiple Choice tasks, and find that even simple versions of our model perform competitively. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance of 65.8% on the Visual7W Telling task and competes surprisingly well with the most complex systems proposed for the VQA Real Multiple Choice task. Additionally, we explore variants of our model and study the transferability of our model between both datasets. We also present an error analysis of our best model, the results of which suggests that a key problem of current VQA systems lies in the lack of visual grounding and localization of concepts that occur in the questions and answers. version:1

Bennett, Selina La Barbera, Adrien F. Vincent, Fabien Alibart, Damien Querlioz category:cs.NE nlin.AO  published:2016-06-27 summary:Memristive nanodevices offer new frontiers for computing systems that unite arithmetic and memory operations on-chip. Here, we explore the integration of electrochemical metallization cell (ECM) nanodevices with tunable filamentary switching in nanoscale learning systems. Such devices offer a natural transition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP). In this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve noisy classification tasks. A single crossbar learning scheme is first introduced and evaluated. Perfect classification is possible only for simple input patterns, within critical timing parameters, and when device variability is weak. To overcome these limitations, a dual-crossbar learning system partly inspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is then introduced. This approach outperforms a conventional ELM-inspired system when the first layer is imprinted before training and testing, and especially so when variability in device timing evolution is considered: variability is therefore transformed from an issue to a feature. In attempting to classify the MNIST database under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84% classification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88% classification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92% classification. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of both systems in terms of energy, complexity, area imprint, and speed. All these results highlight that tuning and exploiting intrinsic device timing parameters may be of central interest to future bio-inspired approximate computing systems. version:1

Nguyen category:cs.DS cs.AI cs.LG  published:2016-06-27 summary:A function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+^E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is DR-submodular if it satisfies $f(\bx + \chi_i) -f (\bx) \ge f(\by + \chi_i) - f(\by)$ for all $\bx\le \by, i\in E$. Recently, the problem of maximizing a DR-submodular function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+^E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ subject to a budget constraint $\ \bx\ _1 \leq B$ as well as additional constraints has received significant attention \cite{SKIK14,SY15,MYK15,SY16}. In this note, we give a generic reduction from the DR-submodular setting to the submodular setting. The running time of the reduction and the size of the resulting submodular instance depends only \emph{logarithmically} on $B$. Using this reduction, one can translate the results for unconstrained and constrained submodular maximization to the DR-submodular setting for many types of constraints in a unified manner. version:1

Yet, a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However, propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime. version:1

Duarte, Benjamin Marlin category:stat.ML cs.CG cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE  published:2016-06-27 summary:This paper proposes an out-of-sample extension framework for a global manifold learning algorithm (Isomap) that uses temporal information in out-of-sample points in order to make the embedding more robust to noise and artifacts. Given a set of noise-free training data and its embedding, the proposed framework extends the embedding for a noisy time series. This is achieved by adding a spatio-temporal compactness term to the optimization objective of the embedding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method for out-of-sample extension of manifold embeddings that leverages timing information available for the extension set. Experimental results demonstrate that our out-of-sample extension algorithm renders a more robust and accurate embedding of sequentially ordered image data in the presence of various noise and artifacts when compared to other timing-aware embeddings. version:1

We want to test whether a representation of informal words fulfills the promise of eliding explicit text normalization as a preprocessing step.

Uncovering the reasons for people exhibiting this strong assortative mixing in social networks is of great interest to researchers and in practice. A popular case application exploiting the insights about social correlation in social networks is in marketing and product promotion. Suggested tendencies to induce observed social correlation are homophily and social influence. However, clearly identifying the causal relationship between these tendencies has proven to be a hard task. In this study we present the interplay between communication happening on Twitter (represented by user mentions) and different semantical aspects of user communication content (tweets). As a semantic relatedness metric we employ a database built from the English Wikipedia corpus according to the Explicit Semantic Analysis method. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily on communication in social networks. Moreover, we quantify diverse levels of homophily and/or social influence, identify the semantic traits as the foci of such homophily, show insights in the temporal evolution of the homophily and influence and finally, we present their intricate interplay with the communication in Twitter. version:1

Such training techniques, however, do not transfer easily to spiking networks due to the spike generation hard non-linearity and the discrete nature of spike communication. We show that in a feedforward spiking network that uses a temporal coding scheme where information is encoded in spike times instead of spike rates, the network input-output relation is differentiable almost everywhere. Moreover, this relation is locally linear after a transformation of variables. Methods for training ANNs thus carry directly to the training of such spiking networks as we show when training on the permutation invariant MNIST task. In contrast to rate-based spiking networks that are often used to approximate the behavior of ANNs, the networks we present spike much more sparsely and their behavior can not be directly approximated by conventional ANNs. Our results highlight a new approach for controlling the behavior of spiking networks with realistic temporal dynamics, opening up the potential for using these networks to process spike patterns with complex temporal information. version:1

However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform link prediction, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task. version:1

Expanding on previous proposals, we suggest that some important aspects of semantic knowledge can be modeled as a language model if done at an appropriate level of abstraction. We develop two distinct models that capture semantic frame chains and discourse information while abstracting over the specific mentions of predicates and entities. For each model, we investigate four implementations: a "standard" N-gram language model and three discriminatively trained "neural" language models that generate embeddings for semantic frames. The quality of the semantic language models (SemLM) is evaluated both intrinsically, using perplexity and a narrative cloze test and extrinsically - we show that our SemLM helps improve performance on semantic natural language processing tasks such as co-reference resolution and discourse parsing. version:2

We propose the application of two techniques to improve model performance, namely, data augmentation, and a method to account for shifts in the input data distribution. We also empirically study the use of generalised distillation, and a novel alternative model that directly predicts item embeddings.

One of the propositions of the dependent random measures is that the atoms of the posterior distribution are shared amongst groups, and hence groups can borrow information from each other. When normalized dependent random measures prior with independent increments are applied, we can derive appropriate exchangeable probability partition function (EPPF), and subsequently also deduce its inference algorithm given any mixture model likelihood. We provide all necessary derivation and solution to this framework. For demonstration, we used mixture of Gaussians likelihood in combination with a dependent structure constructed by linear combinations of CRMs. Our experiments show superior performance when using this framework, where the inferred values including the mixing weights and the number of clusters both respond appropriately to the number of completely random measure used. version:1

Valenzuela-Esc√°rcega, Mihai Surdeanu category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-26 summary:Causal precedence between biochemical interactions is crucial in the biomedical domain, because it transforms collections of individual interactions, e.g., bindings and phosphorylations, into the causal mechanisms needed to inform meaningful search and inference. Here, we analyze causal precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and latent representation models. The highest-performing individual model achieved a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler temporal-only precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points. version:1

However, the power of social media simultaneously enables harmful online behavior such as harassment and bullying. Cyberbullying is a serious social problem, making it an important topic in social network analysis. Machine learning methods can potentially help provide better understanding of this phenomenon, but they must address several key challenges: the rapidly changing vocabulary involved in cyber- bullying, the role of social network structure, and the scale of the data. In this study, we propose a model that simultaneously discovers instigators and victims of bullying as well as new bullying vocabulary by starting with a corpus of social interactions and a seed dictionary of bullying indicators. We formulate an objective function based on participant-vocabulary consistency. We evaluate this approach on Twitter and Ask.fm data sets and show that the proposed method can detect new bullying vocabulary as well as victims and bullies. version:1

Morton, Lewis D. Griffin category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-26 summary:Non-intrusive inspection systems based on X-ray radiography techniques are routinely used at transport hubs to ensure the conformity of cargo content with the supplied shipping manifest. As trade volumes increase and regulations become more stringent, manual inspection by trained operators is less and less viable due to low throughput. Machine vision techniques can assist operators in their task by automating parts of the inspection workflow. Since cars are routinely involved in trafficking, export fraud, and tax evasion schemes, they represent an attractive target for automated detection and flagging for subsequent inspection by operators. In this contribution, we describe a method for the detection of cars in X-ray cargo images based on trained-from-scratch Convolutional Neural Networks. By introducing an oversampling scheme that suitably addresses the low number of car images available for training, we achieved 100% car image classification rate for a false positive rate of 1-in-454. Cars that were partially or completely obscured by other goods, a modus operandi frequently adopted by criminals, were correctly detected. We believe that this level of performance suggests that the method is suitable for deployment in the field. It is expected that the generic object detection workflow described can be extended to other object classes given the availability of suitable training data. version:1

Fraiberger, Robert Moakler, Foster Provost category:stat.ML cs.CY  published:2016-06-26 summary:Recent studies have shown that information disclosed on social network sites (such as Facebook) can be used to predict personal characteristics with surprisingly high accuracy. In this paper we examine a method to give online users transparency into why certain inferences are made about them by statistical models, and control to inhibit those inferences by hiding ("cloaking") certain personal information from inference. We use this method to examine whether such transparency and control would be a reasonable goal by assessing how difficult it would be for users to actually inhibit inferences. Applying the method to data from a large collection of real users on Facebook, we show that a user must cloak only a small portion of her Facebook Likes in order to inhibit inferences about their personal characteristics. However, we also show that in response a firm could change its modeling of users to make cloaking more difficult. version:1

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200,000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the $D \times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in $O(d^{2})$ per example instead of $O(Dd)$, remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of up to $D/4d$ i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture. version:1

Latent-dynamic conditional random field (LDCRF) is a well-known discriminative method that has been successfully used for this task. However, LDCRF can only be trained with pre-segmented data sequences in which the label of each frame is available. In the realm of neural networks, the invention of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) made it possible to train Recurrent Neural Networks on unsegmented sequences with great success. In this paper, we use CTC to train LDCRF model on unsegmented sequences. Experimental results on gesture recognition tasks show that our proposed method can outperform LDCRF, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields. version:1

Eberly category:stat.ME q-bio.QM stat.ML  published:2016-06-26 summary:High-dimensional linear classifiers, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and distance weighted discrimination (DWD), are commonly used in biomedical research to distinguish groups of subjects based on a large number of features. However, their use is limited to applications where a single vector of features is measured for each subject. In practice data are often multi-way, or measured over multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured over multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over multiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear classification of high-dimensional multi-way data, in which coefficients can be factorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally, the coefficients for each measurement in a multi-way dataset are assumed to have low-rank structure. This framework extends existing classification techniques, and we have implemented multi-way versions of SVM and DWD. We describe informative simulation results, and apply multi-way DWD to data for two very different clinical research studies. The first study uses metabolite magnetic resonance spectroscopy data over multiple brain regions to compare patients with and without spinocerebellar ataxia, the second uses publicly available gene expression time-course data to compare treatment responses for patients with multiple sclerosis. Our method improves performance and simplifies interpretation over naive applications of full rank linear classification to multi-way data.

However, only partial information about the matrix representing the linear combinations is available. Assuming a low-rank structure for the matrix, one natural solution would be to first apply a matrix completion on the data, and then to solve the resulting compressed sensing problem. In big data applications such as massive MIMO and medical data, the matrix completion step imposes a huge computational burden. Here, we propose to reduce the computational cost of the completion task by ignoring the columns corresponding to zero elements in the sparse vector. To this end, we employ a technique to initially approximate the support of the sparse vector. We further propose to unify the partial matrix completion and sparse vector recovery into an augmented four-step problem. Simulation results reveal that the augmented approach achieves the best performance, while both proposed methods outperform the natural two-step technique with substantially less computational requirements. version:1

Designing a generic, automated method that works for various objects and imaging modalities is a formidable task. Instead of proposing a new specific segmentation algorithm, we present a general design principle on how to integrate user interactions from the perspective of feedback control theory. Impulsive control and Lyapunov stability analysis are employed to design and analyze an interactive segmentation system. Then stabilization conditions are derived to guide algorithm design. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of proposed method are demonstrated. version:1

Chinnakotla, Manish Shrivastava category:cs.IR cs.CL  published:2016-06-22 summary:Community Question Answering (cQA) forums have become a popular medium for soliciting direct answers to specific questions of users from experts or other experienced users on a given topic. However, for a given question, users sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or b) use deep learning (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required feature representations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as - "Deep Feature Fusion Network (DFFN)" which leverages the advantages of both hand-crafted features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along with its metadata, DFFN independently - a) learns deep features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and b) computes hand-crafted features using various external resources and then combines them using a deep neural network trained to predict the final answer quality. DFFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 benchmark datasets and outperforms baseline approaches which individually employ either HCF or DL based techniques alone. version:2

Unlike existing reviews covering a holistic view on BioIE, this review focuses on mainly recent advances in learning based approaches, by systematically summarizing them into different aspects of methodological development. In addition, we dive into open information extraction and deep learning, two emerging and influential techniques and envision next generation of BioIE. version:1
arxiv-1002-0747 | Efficient Bayesian Learning in Social Networks with Gaussian Estimators | http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0747 | id:1002.0747 author:Elchanan Mossel, Noah Olsman, Omer Tamuz category:stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML  published:2010-02-03 summary:We consider a group of Bayesian agents who try to estimate a state of the world $\theta$ through interaction on a social network. Each agent $v$ initially receives a private measurement of $\theta$: a number $S_v$ picked from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\theta$ and standard deviation one. Then, in each discrete time iteration, each reveals its estimate of $\theta$ to its neighbors, and, observing its neighbors' actions, updates its belief using Bayes' Law. This process aggregates information efficiently, in the sense that all the agents converge to the belief that they would have, had they access to all the private measurements. We show that this process is computationally efficient, so that each agent's calculation can be easily carried out. We also show that on any graph the process converges after at most $2N \cdot D$ steps, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Finally, we show that on trees and on distance transitive-graphs the process converges after $D$ steps, and that it preserves privacy, so that agents learn very little about the private signal of most other agents, despite the efficient aggregation of information. Our results extend those in an unpublished manuscript of the first and last authors. version:3

Since psychological attribute datasets typically suffer from small sample sizes, we apply transfer learning with two base models to avoid overfitting. These models were trained on an age and gender prediction task, respectively. Using a novel explanation method we extract heatmaps that highlight the parts of the image most responsible for the prediction. We further observe that the explanation method provides important insights into the nature of features of the base model, which allow one to assess the aptitude of the base model for a given transfer learning task. Finally, we observe that the multiclass model is more feature rich than its binary counterpart. The experimental evaluation is performed on the 2222 images from the 10k US faces dataset containing psychological attribute labels as well as on a subset of KDEF images. version:2

In this paper, a new method for feature extraction that is based on maximization of local Gaussian correlation function of wavelet coefficients and signal is presented. The effect of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose multi-component signals to intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), before using of local Gaussian correlation is discussed. The experimental vibration signals from two gearbox systems are used to show the efficiency of the presented method. Linear support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to classify feature sets extracted with the presented method. The obtained results show that the features extracted in this method have excellent ability to classify faults without any additional feature selection; it is also shown that EMD can improve or degrade features according to the utilized feature reduction method. version:1
arxiv-1606-07970 | A Tucker decomposition process for probabilistic modeling of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07970 | id:1606.07970 author:Hernan Dario Vargas Cardona, Mauricio A. Alvarez, Alvaro A. Orozco category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-25 summary:Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an emerging medical technique used for describing water diffusion in an organic tissue. Typically, rank-2 tensors quantify this diffusion. From this quantification, it is possible to calculate relevant scalar measures (i.e. fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) employed in clinical diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, 2nd-order tensors fail to represent complex tissue structures like crossing fibers. To overcome this limitation, several researchers proposed a diffusion representation with higher order tensors (HOT), specifically 4th and 6th orders. However, the current acquisition protocols of dMRI data allow images with a spatial resolution between 1 $mm^3$ and 2 $mm^3$. This voxel size is much smaller than tissue structures. Therefore, several clinical procedures derived from dMRI may be inaccurate. Interpolation has been used to enhance resolution of dMRI in a tensorial space. Most interpolation methods are valid only for rank-2 tensors and a generalization for HOT data is missing. In this work, we propose a novel stochastic process called Tucker decomposition process (TDP) for performing HOT data interpolation. Our model is based on the Tucker decomposition and Gaussian processes as parameters of the TDP. We test the TDP in 2nd, 4th and 6th rank HOT fields. For rank-2 tensors, we compare against direct interpolation, log-Euclidean approach and Generalized Wishart processes. For rank-4 and rank-6 tensors we compare against direct interpolation. Results obtained show that TDP interpolates accurately the HOT fields and generalizes to any rank. version:1

Alvarez, Alvaro A. Orozco category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-25 summary:Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive tool for watching the microstructure of fibrous nerve and muscle tissue. From dMRI, it is possible to estimate 2-rank diffusion tensors imaging (DTI) fields, that are widely used in clinical applications: tissue segmentation, fiber tractography, brain atlas construction, brain conductivity models, among others. Due to hardware limitations of MRI scanners, DTI has the difficult compromise between spatial resolution and signal noise ratio (SNR) during acquisition. For this reason, the data are often acquired with very low resolution. To enhance DTI data resolution, interpolation provides an interesting software solution. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for DTI interpolation that enhance the spatial resolution of DTI fields. We assume that a DTI field follows a recently introduced stochastic process known as a generalized Wishart process (GWP), which we use as a prior over the diffusion tensor field. For posterior inference, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We perform experiments in toy and real data. Results of GWP outperform other methods in the literature, when compared in different validation protocols. version:1
arxiv-1606-07967 | Leveraging Semantic Web Search and Browse Sessions for Multi-Turn Spoken Dialog Systems | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07967 | id:1606.07967 author:Lu Wang, Larry Heck, Dilek Hakkani-Tur category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-25 summary:Training statistical dialog models in spoken dialog systems (SDS) requires large amounts of annotated data. The lack of scalable methods for data mining and annotation poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art statistical dialog managers. This paper presents an approach that directly leverage billions of web search and browse sessions to overcome this hurdle. The key insight is that task completion through web search and browse sessions is (a) predictable and (b) generalizes to spoken dialog task completion. The new method automatically mines behavioral search and browse patterns from web logs and translates them into spoken dialog models. We experiment with naturally occurring spoken dialogs and large scale web logs. Our session-based models outperform the state-of-the-art method for entity extraction task in SDS. We also achieve better performance for both entity and relation extraction on web search queries when compared with nontrivial baselines. version:1

We explore and compare token-level and dialogue act-level automatic summarization methods using both unsupervised and supervised learning frameworks. In the supervised summarization setting, and given true clusterings of decision-related utterances, we find that token-level summaries that employ discourse context can approach an upper bound for decision abstracts derived directly from dialogue acts. In the unsupervised summarization setting,we find that summaries based on unsupervised partitioning of decision-related utterances perform comparably to those based on partitions generated using supervised techniques (0.22 ROUGE-F1 using LDA-based topic models vs. 0.23 using SVMs). version:1

arxiv-1606-07950 | Word sense disambiguation via bipartite representation of complex networks | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07950 | id:1606.07950 author:Edilson A. Correa Jr., Alneu de Andrade Lopes, Diego R. Amancio category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-25 summary:In recent years, concepts and methods of complex networks have been employed to tackle the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task by representing words as nodes, which are connected if they are semantically similar. Despite the increasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use networks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on the attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In other words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly used in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations have probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and graphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible links between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite network model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing the context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written texts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of words, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the proposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also constructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished. Our results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite networks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed to characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the support vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of being robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the results obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification method might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written texts. version:1

Rush category:cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE  published:2016-06-25 summary:Neural machine translation (NMT) offers a novel alternative formulation of translation that is potentially simpler than statistical approaches. However to reach competitive performance, NMT models need to be exceedingly large. In this paper we consider applying knowledge distillation approaches (Bucila et al, 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) that have proven successful for reducing the size of neural models in other domains to the problem of NMT. We demonstrate that standard knowledge distillation applied to word-level prediction can be effective for NMT, and also introduce two novel sequence-level versions of knowledge distillation that further improve performance, and somewhat surprisingly, seem to eliminate the need for beam search (even when applied on the original teacher model). Our best student model runs 10 times faster than its state-of-the-art teacher with only a decrease of 0.2 BLEU. It is also significantly better than a baseline model trained without knowledge distillation: by 4.2/1.7 BLEU with greedy decoding/beam search. version:1

MI-SMF and MI-ACE estimate a discriminative target signature from imprecisely-labeled and mixed training data. In many applications, such as sub-pixel target detection in remotely-sensed hyperspectral imagery, accurate pixel-level labels on training data is often unavailable and infeasible to obtain. Furthermore, since sub-pixel targets are smaller in size than the resolution of a single pixel, training data is comprised only of mixed data points (in which target training points are mixtures of responses from both target and non-target classes). Results show improved, consistent performance over existing multiple instance concept learning methods on several hyperspectral sub-pixel target detection problems. version:2

Different from other problems like tag assignment or similar, a) we assume multiple images are used as input instead of single image, b) Input images are typically not visually related, c) Input images are not necessarily semantically close, and d) Output word space is unconstrained. In our proposed solution, visual information of each query image is used to retrieve similar images with text labels (tags) from an image database. We consider a scenario where the tags are very noisy and diverse, given that they were obtained by implicit crowd-sourcing in a database of 1 million images and over seventy seven thousand tags. The words or tags associated to each query are processed jointly in a word selection algorithm using random walks that allows to refine the search topic, rejecting words that are not part of the topic and produce a set of words that fairly describe the topic. Experiments on a dataset of 300 topics, with up to twenty images per topic, show that our algorithm performs better than the proposed baseline for any number of query images. We also present a new Conditional Random Field (CRF) word mapping algorithm that preserves the semantic similarity of the mapped words, increasing the performance of the results over the baseline. version:1

The trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically large. The question we would like to address is whether it is possible to simplify the NN during training process to achieve a reasonable performance within an acceptable computational time. We presented a novel approach of optimising a deep neural network through regularisation of net- work architecture. We proposed regularisers which support a simple mechanism of dropping neurons during a network training process. The method supports the construction of a simpler deep neural networks with compatible performance with its simplified version. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the proposed method with examples including sparse linear regression, deep autoencoder and convolutional neural network. The valuations demonstrate excellent performance. The code for this work can be found in http://www.github.com/panweihit/DropNeuron. version:2

Specifically, we identify four fundamental criteria based on the characteristics of natural language that pose difficulties to NLP systems; and develop tests that directly show whether or not representations contain the subspaces necessary to satisfy these criteria. Current intrinsic evaluations are mostly based on the overall similarity or full-space similarity of words and thus view vector representations as points. We show the limits of these point-based intrinsic evaluations. We apply our evaluation methodology to the comparison of a count vector model and several neural network models and demonstrate important properties of these models. version:1

The application of entity typing we are interested in is knowledge base completion, specifically, to learn which classes an entity is a member of. We propose FIGMENT to tackle this problem. FIGMENT is embedding-based and combines (i) a global model that scores based on aggregated contextual information of an entity and (ii) a context model that first scores the individual occurrences of an entity and then aggregates the scores. In our evaluation, FIGMENT strongly outperforms an approach to entity typing that relies on relations obtained by an open information extraction system. version:1

However, these approaches come with an at least quadratic computational cost in the number of observations, which can be prohibitive in many applications. Arguably, it is exactly in such large-scale datasets that capturing any type of dependence is of interest, so striking a favourable tradeoff between computational efficiency and test performance for kernel independence tests would have a direct impact on their applicability in practice. In this contribution, we provide an extensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context of independence testing, contrasting block-based, Nystrom and random Fourier feature approaches. Through a variety of synthetic data experiments, it is demonstrated that our novel large scale methods give comparable performance with existing methods whilst using significantly less computation time and memory. version:1

However, generalized pixel-level anticipation in computer vision systems is difficult because machine learning struggles with the ambiguity inherent in predicting the future. In this paper, we focus on predicting the dense trajectory of pixels in a scene, specifically what will move in the scene, where it will travel, and how it will deform over the course of one second. We propose a conditional variational autoencoder as a solution to this problem. In this framework, direct inference from the image shapes the distribution of possible trajectories, while latent variables encode any necessary information that is not available in the image. We show that our method is able to successfully predict events in a wide variety of scenes and can produce multiple different predictions when the future is ambiguous. Our algorithm is trained on thousands of diverse, realistic videos and requires absolutely no human labeling. In addition to non-semantic action prediction, we find that our method learns a representation that is applicable to semantic vision tasks. version:1

By exploiting the parametric structure of the direct current optimal power flow, a new technique based on online dictionary learning (ODL) is proposed. The ODL approach incorporates real-time measurements and historical traces to produce forecasts of joint and marginal probability distributions of future locational marginal prices, power flows, and dispatch levels, conditional on the system state at the time of forecasting. Compared with standard Monte Carlo simulation techniques, the ODL approach offers several orders of magnitude improvement in computation time, making it feasible for online forecasting of market operations. Numerical simulations on large and moderate size power systems illustrate its performance and complexity features and its potential as a tool for system operators. version:1

Machado, Liam Paninski category:stat.CO stat.ML  published:2016-06-24 summary:A common analytical problem in neuroscience is the interpretation of neural activity with respect to sensory input or behavioral output. This is typically achieved by regressing measured neural activity against known stimuli or behavioral variables to produce a "tuning function" for each neuron. Unfortunately, because this approach handles neurons individually, it cannot take advantage of simultaneous measurements from spatially adjacent neurons that often have similar tuning properties. On the other hand, sharing information between adjacent neurons can errantly degrade estimates of tuning functions across space if there are sharp discontinuities in tuning between nearby neurons. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient block Gibbs sampler that effectively pools information between neurons to de-noise tuning function estimates while simultaneously preserving sharp discontinuities that might exist in the organization of tuning across space. This method is fully Bayesian and its computational cost per iteration scales sub-quadratically with total parameter dimensionality. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of this approach by applying it to both real and synthetic datasets. In particular, an application to data from the spinal cord illustrates that the proposed methods can dramatically decrease the experimental time required to accurately estimate tuning functions. version:1

The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover, as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. version:1

In these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. In this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. Our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. Our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. We also show qualitatively that solutions produced from our approach often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity. version:1

Roth, Le Lu, Amal Farag, Andrew Sohn, Ronald M. Summers category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-24 summary:Accurate automatic organ segmentation is an important yet challenging problem for medical image analysis. The pancreas is an abdominal organ with very high anatomical variability. This inhibits traditional segmentation methods from achieving high accuracies, especially compared to other organs such as the liver, heart or kidneys. In this paper, we present a holistic learning approach that integrates semantic mid-level cues of deeply-learned organ interior and boundary maps via robust spatial aggregation using random forest. Our method generates boundary preserving pixel-wise class labels for pancreas segmentation. Quantitative evaluation is performed on CT scans of 82 patients in 4-fold cross-validation. We achieve a (mean $\pm$ std. dev.) Dice Similarity Coefficient of 78.01% $\pm$ 8.2% in testing which significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach of 71.8% $\pm$ 10.7% under the same evaluation criterion. version:1

Concretely, a series of unsupervised topic models is explored and experimental results show that fine-grained topic models, which discover topics at the utterance-level rather than the document-level, can better identify the gist of the decision-making process. Moreover, our proposed token-level summarization approach, which is able to remove redundancies within utterances, outperforms existing utterance ranking based summarization methods. Finally, context information is also investigated to add additional relevant information to the summary. version:1

People in the videos are expected to intentionally take shortest paths toward functional objects subject to obstacles, where people can satisfy certain needs (e.g., a vending machine can quench thirst), by following one of three possible intent behaviors: reach a single functional object and stop, or sequentially visit several functional objects, or initially start moving toward one goal but then change the intent to move toward another. Since detecting functional objects in low-resolution surveillance videos is typically unreliable, we call them "dark matter" characterized by the functionality to attract people. We formulate the Agent-based Lagrangian Mechanics wherein human trajectories are probabilistically modeled as motions of agents in many layers of "dark-energy" fields, where each agent can select a particular force field to affect its motions, and thus define the minimum-energy Dijkstra path toward the corresponding source "dark matter". For evaluation, we compiled and annotated a new dataset. The results demonstrate our effectiveness in predicting human intent behaviors and trajectories, and localizing functional objects, as well as discovering distinct functional classes of objects by clustering human motion behavior in the vicinity of functional objects. version:1

Vuurens, Carsten Eickhoff, Arjen P. de Vries category:cs.CL cs.DC  published:2016-06-24 summary:Since its introduction, Word2Vec and its variants are widely used to learn semantics-preserving representations of words or entities in an embedding space, which can be used to produce state-of-art results for various Natural Language Processing tasks. Existing implementations aim to learn efficiently by running multiple threads in parallel while operating on a single model in shared memory, ignoring incidental memory update collisions. We show that these collisions can degrade the efficiency of parallel learning, and propose a straightforward caching strategy that improves the efficiency by a factor of 4. version:1

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow. version:1

Moreover, it combines the information from the past and the future words for classification. Our proposed CNN architecture outperforms even the previously best ensembling recurrent neural network model and achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1-score of 95.61% on the ATIS benchmark dataset without using any additional linguistic knowledge and resources. version:1

Reagan, Lewis Mitchell, Dilan Kiley, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-24 summary:Advances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of text now make it possible to study our a culture's evolution through its texts using a "big data" lens. Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads. version:1

Recent captioning models are limited in their ability to scale and describe concepts outside of paired image-text corpora. Our model takes advantage of external sources - labeled images from object recognition datasets, and semantic knowledge extracted from unannotated text - and combines them to generate descriptions about novel objects. We propose minimizing a joint objective which can learn from diverse data sources and leverage distributional semantic embeddings, enabling the model to generalize and describe novel objects outside of image-caption datasets. We demonstrate that our model exploits semantic information to generate captions for hundreds of object categories in the ImageNet object recognition dataset that are not observed in image-caption training data, as well as many categories that are observed very rarely. version:1

Deep feedforward neural networks with many hidden layers also suffer from this effect. In this paper we propose a novel universal technique that makes the norm of the gradient stay in the suitable range. We construct a way to estimate a contribution of each training example to the norm of the long-term components of the target function s gradient. Using this subroutine we can construct mini-batches for the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training that leads to high performance and accuracy of the trained network even for very complex tasks. We provide a straightforward mathematical estimation of minibatch s impact on for the gradient norm and prove its correctness theoretically. To check our framework experimentally we use some special synthetic benchmarks for testing RNNs on ability to capture long-term dependencies. Our network can detect links between events in the (temporal) sequence at the range approx. 100 and longer. version:1

The SVDD model for normal data description builds a minimum radius hypersphere around the training data. A flexible description can be obtained by use of Kernel functions. The data description is defined by the support vectors obtained by solving quadratic optimization problem which minimizes the volume enclosed by the hypersphere. The time required to solve the quadratic programming problem is directly related to the number of observations in the training data set. This leads to very high computing time for large training datasets. In this paper we propose a new iterative sampling-based method for SVDD training. The method incrementally learns the training data set description at each iteration by computing SVDD on an independent random sample selected with replacement from the training data set. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is extremely fast and provides near-identical data description as compared to training using the entire data set in one iteration. Proposed method can be easily implemented as a wrapper code around the core module for SVDD training computations either in a single machine or a multi-machine distributed environment. version:2

However, understanding what a network has learned still proves to be a challenging task. To remedy this unsatisfactory situation, a number of groups have recently proposed different methods to visualize the learned models. In this work we suggest a general taxonomy to classify and compare these methods, subdividing the literature into three main categories and providing researchers with a terminology to base their works on. Furthermore, we introduce the FeatureVis library for MatConvNet: an extendable, easy to use open source library for visualizing CNNs. It contains implementations from each of the three main classes of visualization methods and serves as a useful tool for an enhanced understanding of the features learned by intermediate layers, as well as for the analysis of why a network might fail for certain examples. version:1

Gallagher, Andrew J. Reagan, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds category:cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI  published:2016-06-22 summary:Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. In particular, we introduce methodology that not only quantifies these divergences, but also reveals whether they are from widespread discussion or a few popular retweets within these groups. We find that #BlackLivesMatter exhibits many informationally rich conversations, while those within #AllLivesMatter are more muted and susceptible to hijacking. We also show that the discussion within #BlackLivesMatter is more likely to center around the deaths of Black Americans, while that of #AllLivesMatter is more likely to sympathize with the lives of police officers and express politically conservative views. version:2

The words simultaneously update their class membership preferences according to the senses that neighboring words are likely to choose. We use distributional information to weigh the influence that each word has on the decisions of the others and semantic similarity information to measure the strength of compatibility among the choices. With this information we can formulate the word sense disambiguation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem and solve it using tools derived from game theory, maintaining the textual coherence. The model is based on two ideas: similar words should be assigned to similar classes and the meaning of a word does not depend on all the words in a text but just on some of them. The paper provides an in-depth motivation of the idea of modeling the word sense disambiguation problem in terms of game theory, which is illustrated by an example. The conclusion presents an extensive analysis on the combination of similarity measures to use in the framework and a comparison with state-of-the-art systems. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and can be applied to different tasks and in different scenarios. version:2

Oentaryo, Ee-Peng Lim, Freddy Chong Tat Chua, Jia-Wei Low, David Lo category:cs.SI cs.LG  published:2016-06-24 summary:The abundance of user-generated data in social media has incentivized the development of methods to infer the latent attributes of users, which are crucially useful for personalization, advertising and recommendation. However, the current user profiling approaches have limited success, due to the lack of a principled way to integrate different types of social relationships of a user, and the reliance on scarcely-available labeled data in building a prediction model. In this paper, we present a novel solution termed Collective Semi-Supervised Learning (CSL), which provides a principled means to integrate different types of social relationship and unlabeled data under a unified computational framework. The joint learning from multiple relationships and unlabeled data yields a computationally sound and accurate approach to model user attributes in social media. Extensive experiments using Twitter data have demonstrated the efficacy of our CSL approach in inferring user attributes such as account type and marital status. We also show how CSL can be used to determine important user features, and to make inference on a larger user population. version:1

Plumbley category:cs.CV cs.AI  published:2016-06-24 summary:Acoustic event detection for content analysis in most cases relies on lots of labeled data. However, manually annotating data is a time-consuming task, which thus makes few annotated resources available so far. Unlike audio event detection, automatic audio tagging, a multi-label acoustic event classification task, only relies on weakly labeled data. This is highly desirable to some practical applications using audio analysis. In this paper we propose to use a fully deep neural network (DNN) framework to handle the multi-label classification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level rather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames of the chunk were fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the expected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can well map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. A deep pyramid structure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related to the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the Dropout and background noise aware training, to enhance its generalization capability for new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, the proposed fully DNN-based method could well utilize the long-term temporal information with the whole chunk as the input. The results show that our approach obtained a 15% relative improvement compared with the official GMM-based method of DCASE 2016 challenge. version:1

However the necessity to solve corresponding linear systems at each time step constitutes a complexity bottleneck in their application to PDEs with rough coefficients. We present a generalization of gamblets introduced in arXiv:1503.03467 enabling the resolution of these implicit systems in near-linear complexity and provide rigorous a-priori error bounds on the resulting numerical approximations of hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs. These generalized gamblets induce a multiresolution decomposition of the solution space that is adapted to both the underlying (hyperbolic and parabolic) PDE (and the system of ODEs resulting from space discretization) and to the time-steps of the numerical scheme. version:1

In the last decades, few attempts where done to handle that objective with Neural Networks, but recently an architecture based on Autoencoders proved to be a promising approach. In current paper, we enhanced that architecture (i) by using a loss function adapted to input data with missing values, and (ii) by incorporating side information. The experiments demonstrate that while side information only slightly improve the test error averaged on all users/items, it has more impact on cold users/items. version:1

We consider maximizing the mean value (the predominant approach in policy search) and minimizing the expected Bellman residual (the Bellman residual being prevalent in approximate dynamic programming). For doing so, we introduce a new approach that consists in minimizing the mean residual $\nu(T_* v_\pi - v_\pi)$ for a class of parameterized policies. We prove that this method enjoys a performance bound that is better than the sole known bound for maximizing the mean value and that matches the best known bounds in approximate dynamic programming. We also conduct experiments on randomly generated generic Markov decision processes to compare both approaches empirically. It appears that maximizing the mean value is much more efficient, and that the Bellman residual is actually not a such good proxy for optimizing a value function. This suggests to envision maximizing the mean value for designing new reinforcement learning approaches, and that much remains to be done regarding its theoretical analysis. version:1

However, existing models still have a couple of limitations in interpreting the dimensions of word vector. In this paper, we provide a new approach---roots and affixes model(RAAM)---to interpret it from the intrinsic structures of natural language. Also it can be used as an evaluation measure of the quality of word embedding. We introduce the information entropy into our model and divide the dimensions into two categories, just like roots and affixes in lexical semantics. Then considering each category as a whole rather than individually. We experimented with English Wikipedia corpus. Our result show that there is a negative linear relation between the two attributes and a high positive correlation between our model and downstream semantic evaluation tasks. version:1

In this paper, we present a novel ranking-selection framework for low-length but highly correlated instances. Instead of working in the low-dimensional instance space, we learn a supervised projection to high-dimensional space spanned by the number of classes in the dataset under study. Imposing higher distinctions via exposing the notion of labels to the instances, lets to deploy one versus all ranking for each individual classes and selecting quality instances via adaptive thresholding of the overall scores. To prove the efficiency of our paradigm, we employ it for the purpose of texture understanding which is a hard recognition challenge due to high similarity of texture pixels and low dimensionality of their color features. Our experiments show considerable improvements in recognition performance over other local descriptors on several publicly available datasets. version:1

While there are numerous works that focus on establishing that two resources are identical and on adding more instances of an already existing relation, the problem of finding new relations between any two given datasets has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, given two entity sets, we present an unsupervised approach to enrich the LOD cloud with new relations between them by exploiting the web corpus. During the first phase we gather prospective relations from the corpus through pattern extraction and paraphrase detection. In the second phase, we perform actual enrichment by extracting instances of these relations. We have empirically evaluated our approach on several dataset pairs and found that the system can indeed be used for enriching the existing datasets with new relations. version:1

For example, one may require a classifier to also make positive predictions at some specified rate for some subpopulation (fairness), or to achieve a specified empirical recall. Other real-world goals include reducing churn with respect to a previously deployed model, or stabilizing online training. In this paper we propose handling multiple goals on multiple datasets by training with dataset constraints, using the ramp penalty to accurately quantify costs, and present an efficient algorithm to approximately optimize the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. version:1

It consists of a pair of generative adversarial networks, each responsible for generating images in one domain. We show that by enforcing a simple weight-sharing constraint, the CoGAN learns to generate pairs of corresponding images without existence of any pairs of corresponding images in the two domains in the training set. In other words, the CoGAN learns a joint distribution of images in the two domains from images drawn separately from the marginal distributions of the individual domains. This is in contrast to the existing multi-modal generative models, which require corresponding images for training. We apply the CoGAN to several pair image generation tasks. For each task, the GoGAN learns to generate convincing pairs of corresponding images. We further demonstrate the applications of the CoGAN framework for the domain adaptation and cross-domain image generation tasks. version:1

In this paper, we propose a novel parametric level set method called Disjunctive Normal Level Set (DNLS), and apply it to both two phase (single object) and multiphase (multi-object) image segmentations. The DNLS is formed by union of polytopes which themselves are formed by intersections of half-spaces. The proposed level set framework has the following major advantages compared to other level set methods available in the literature. First, segmentation using DNLS converges much faster. Second, the DNLS level set function remains regular throughout its evolution. Third, the proposed multiphase version of the DNLS is less sensitive to initialization, and its computational cost and memory requirement remains almost constant as the number of objects to be simultaneously segmented grows. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method. version:1
arxiv-1606-07509 | Convex Decomposition And Efficient Shape Representation Using Deformable Convex Polytopes | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07509 | id:1606.07509 author:Fitsum Mesadi, Tolga Tasdizen category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-23 summary:Decomposition of shapes into (approximate) convex parts is essential for applications such as part-based shape representation, shape matching, and collision detection. In this paper, we propose a novel convex decomposition using a parametric implicit shape model called Disjunctive Normal Shape Model (DNSM). The DNSM is formed as a union of polytopes which themselves are formed by intersections of halfspaces. The key idea is by deforming the polytopes, which naturally remain convex during the evolution, the polytopes capture convex parts without the need to compute convexity. The major contributions of this paper include a robust convex decomposition which also results in an efficient part-based shape representation, and a novel shape convexity measure. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method. version:1

Shahriar Hossain category:cs.CV cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG cs.NE H.2.8; H.3.3; I.2.6  published:2016-06-23 summary:While textual reviews have become prominent in many recommendation-based systems, automated frameworks to provide relevant visual cues against text reviews where pictures are not available is a new form of task confronted by data mining and machine learning researchers. Suggestions of pictures that are relevant to the content of a review could significantly benefit the users by increasing the effectiveness of a review. We propose a deep learning-based framework to automatically: (1) tag the images available in a review dataset, (2) generate a caption for each image that does not have one, and (3) enhance each review by recommending relevant images that might not be uploaded by the corresponding reviewer. We evaluate the proposed framework using the Yelp Challenge Dataset. While a subset of the images in this particular dataset are correctly captioned, the majority of the pictures do not have any associated text. Moreover, there is no mapping between reviews and images. Each image has a corresponding business-tag where the picture was taken, though. The overall data setting and unavailability of crucial pieces required for a mapping make the problem of recommending images for reviews a major challenge. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that our proposed framework provides high quality enhancements through automatic captioning, tagging, and recommendation for mapping reviews and images. version:1

We present multiple approaches, via unary (position) and pairwise (order) predictions, and their ensemble-based combinations, achieving strong results on this task. As features, we use both text-based and image-based features, which depict complementary improvements.

The model takes as input both word histories as well as n-gram counts. Thus, it combines the memorization capacity and scalability of an n-gram model with the generalization ability of neural networks. We report experiments where the model is trained on 26B words. NN-grams are efficient at run-time since they do not include an output soft-max layer. The model is trained using noise contrastive estimation (NCE), an approach that transforms the estimation problem of neural networks into one of binary classification between data samples and noise samples. We present results with noise samples derived from either an n-gram distribution or from speech recognition lattices. NN-grams outperforms an n-gram model on an Italian speech recognition dictation task. version:1

Rush category:cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE  published:2016-06-23 summary:Recurrent neural networks, and in particular long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), are a remarkably effective tool for sequence modeling that learn a dense black-box hidden representation of their sequential input. Researchers interested in better understanding these models have studied the changes in hidden state representations over time and noticed some interpretable patterns but also significant noise. In this work, we present LSTMVis a visual analysis tool for recurrent neural networks with a focus on understanding these hidden state dynamics. The tool allows a user to select a hypothesis input range to focus on local state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns in a large data set, and to align these results with domain specific structural annotations. We further show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific hidden state properties on datasets containing nesting, phrase structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis. version:1

Tamimi, Andrew H. Beck category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-21 summary:The assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images provides important diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information for guiding cancer diagnosis and therapy. Manual scoring of IHC images represents a logistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming. Since the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the application of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of protein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual scoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories and in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is crowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd. The aim of this study is to quantify IHC images for labeling of ER status with two different crowdsourcing approaches, image labeling and nuclei labeling, and compare their performance with automated methods. Crowdsourcing-derived scores obtained greater concordance with the pathologist interpretations for both image labeling and nuclei labeling tasks (83% and 87%), as compared to the pathologist concordance achieved by the automated method (81%) on 5,483 TMA images from 1,909 breast cancer patients. This analysis shows that crowdsourcing the scoring of protein expression in IHC images is a promising new approach for large scale cancer molecular pathology studies. version:2

The observational time and filter fluxes are used as inputs to the network, but since the inputs are agnostic additional data such as host galaxy information can also be included. Using the Supernovae Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC) data, we find that deep networks are capable of learning about light curves, however the performance of the network is highly sensitive to the amount of training data. For a training size of 50% of the representational SPCC dataset (around 104 supernovae) we obtain a type Ia vs non type Ia classification accuracy of 94.8%, an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve AUC of 0.986 and a SPCC figure-of-merit F1 = 0.64. We also apply a pre-trained model to obtain classification probabilities as a function of time, and show it can give early indications of supernovae type. Our method is competitive with existing algorithms and has applications for future large-scale photometric surveys. version:1

Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than 50K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach outperforms alternative methods. We also demonstrate that active data collection using the learned model further improves performance. version:1

Towards this goal, we utilize freely available cartographic maps and derive a probabilistic model that exploits semantic cues in the form of sun direction, presence of an intersection, road type, speed limit as well as the ego-car trajectory in order to produce very reliable localization results. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can localize much faster (in terms of driving time) with less computation and more robustly than competing approaches, which ignore semantic information. version:1

M. Bayer, R. J. Cintra, A. Madanayake category:cs.CV cs.MM cs.NA stat.ME  published:2016-06-23 summary:An orthogonal 16-point approximate discrete cosine transform (DCT) is introduced. The proposed transform requires neither multiplications nor bit-shifting operations. A fast algorithm based on matrix factorization is introduced, requiring only 44 additions---the lowest arithmetic cost in literature. To assess the introduced transform, computational complexity, similarity with the exact DCT, and coding performance measures are computed. Classical and state-of-the-art 16-point low-complexity transforms were used in a comparative analysis. In the context of image compression, the proposed approximation was evaluated via PSNR and SSIM measurements, attaining the best cost-benefit ratio among the competitors. For video encoding, the proposed approximation was embedded into a HEVC reference software for direct comparison with the original HEVC standard. Physically realized and tested using FPGA hardware, the proposed transform showed 35% and 37% improvements of area-time and area-time-squared VLSI metrics when compared to the best competing transform in the literature. version:1

Here we propose a power-efficient approach for real-time inference, in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are implemented through low-power analog circuits. Although analog implementations can be extremely compact, they have been largely supplanted by digital designs, partly because of device mismatch effects due to fabrication. We propose a framework that exploits the power of Deep Learning to compensate for this mismatch by incorporating the measured variations of the devices as constraints in the DNN training process. This eliminates the use of mismatch minimization strategies such as the use of very large transistors, and allows circuit complexity and power-consumption to be reduced to a minimum. Our results, based on large-scale simulations as well as a prototype VLSI chip implementation indicate at least a 3-fold improvement of processing efficiency over current digital implementations. version:1

Our approach builds on Laplacian operators of well-known edge-aware kernels, such as bilateral and nonlocal means, and extends these filter's capabilities to perform more effective and fast image smoothing, sharpening and tone manipulation. We propose an approximation of the Laplacian, which does not require normalization of the kernel weights. Multiple Laplacians of the affinity weights endow our method with progressive detail decomposition of the input image from fine to coarse scale. These image components are blended by a structure mask, which avoids noise/artifact magnification or detail loss in the output image. Contributions of the proposed method to existing image editing tools are: (1) Low computational and memory requirements, making it appropriate for mobile device implementations (e.g. as a finish step in a camera pipeline), (2) A range of filtering applications from detail enhancement to denoising with only a few control parameters, enabling the user to apply a combination of various (and even opposite) filtering effects. version:1

Our agnostic learning model is similar to -- in fact, stronger than -- Huber's contamination model in robust statistics. In this work, we study the fully observable Bernoulli case where the structure of the network is given. Even in this basic setting, previous learning algorithms either run in exponential time or lose dimension-dependent factors in their error guarantees. We provide the first computationally efficient agnostic learning algorithm for this problem with dimension-independent error guarantees. Our algorithm has polynomial sample complexity, runs in polynomial time, and achieves error that scales nearly-linearly with the fraction of adversarially corrupted samples. version:1

However, we observed a phenomenon that the programs based on TD learning still hardly reach large tiles. In this paper, we propose multi-stage TD (MS-TD) learning, a kind of hierarchical reinforcement learning method, to effectively improve the performance for the rates of reaching large tiles, which are good metrics to analyze the strength of 2048 programs. Our experiments showed significant improvements over the one without using MS-TD learning. Namely, using 3-ply expectimax search, the program with MS-TD learning reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 18.31%, while the one with TD learning did not reach any. After further tuned, our 2048 program reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 31.75% in 10,000 games, and one among these games even reached a 65536-tile, which is the first ever reaching a 65536-tile to our knowledge. In addition, MS-TD learning method can be easily applied to other 2048-like games, such as Threes. Based on MS-TD learning, our experiments for Threes also demonstrated similar performance improvement, where the program with MS-TD learning reached 6144-tiles with a rate of 7.83%, while the one with TD learning only reached 0.45%. version:1

But, so far the community has not reached to a consensus on the best way to train and assess models for this task. Casting video understanding as a form of action or event categorization is unsatisfying as it is not clear what the semantic classes or abstractions of this domain should be. Language has been exploited to sidestep the problem of defining abstract video categories by formulating video understanding as the task of captioning or description. However, language is highly complex, redundant and sometimes ambiguous. Many different captions may express the same semantic concept. To account for this ambiguity, quantitative evaluation of video description requires sophisticated metrics, whose performance scores are typically hard to interpret by humans. This paper provides four contributions on this problem. First, we formulate Video Comprehension as a new well-defined task with an easy-to-interpret performance measure. Second, we describe a general semi-automatic procedure to create benchmarks for this task. Third, we publicly release a large-scale video benchmark created with an implementation of this procedure and we include a human study that assesses human performance on our dataset. Finally, we propose and test a varied collection of approaches on this benchmark for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the new challenges posed by video comprehension. version:1

Accuracy is superior to the popular PCA/ICA method based on precision and recall relative to ground truth annotation by a human expert. These results suggest that convolutional networks are an efficient and flexible tool for the analysis of large-scale calcium imaging data. version:1

We study model averaging as a variance-reducing mechanism and describe two ways in which the frequency of averaging affects convergence. For convex objectives, we show the benefit of frequent averaging depends on the gradient variance envelope. For non-convex objectives, we illustrate that this benefit depends on the presence of multiple globally optimal points. We complement our findings with multicore experiments on both synthetic and real data. version:1

The performance of most models is clustered around 60-70%. In this paper we propose systematic methods to analyze the behavior of these models as a first step towards recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying the most fruitful directions for progress. We analyze the best performing models from two major classes of VQA models -- with-attention and without-attention and show the similarities and differences in the behavior of these models. Our behavior analysis reveals that despite recent progress, today's VQA models are "myopic" (tend to fail on sufficiently novel instances), often "jump to conclusions" (converge on a predicted answer after 'listening' to just half the question), and are "stubborn" (do not change their answers across images). version:1

However, while very well established for static images, there is no general agreement on how to compute a saliency map of dynamic scenes. In this paper we propose a mathematically rigorous approach to this prob- lem, including static saliency maps of each video frame for the calculation of the optical flow. Taking into account static saliency maps for calculating the optical flow allows for overcoming the aperture problem. Our ap- proach is able to explain human fixation behavior in situations which pose challenges to standard approaches, such as when a fixated object disappears behind an occlusion and reappears after several frames. In addition, we quantitatively compare our model against alternative solutions using a large eye tracking data set. Together, our results suggest that assessing optical flow information across a series of saliency maps gives a highly accurate and useful account of human overt attention in dynamic scenes. version:1

We propose a simple projected gradient descent method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations as well as nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods. version:1

We make use of an unsupervised learning algorithm that transforms the complex tactile data into a compact, latent representation without the need to record ground truth reference data. These compact representations can either be used directly in a reinforcement learning based controller or can be used to calibrate the tactile sensor to physical quantities with only a few datapoints. We show the quality of our latent representation by predicting important features and with a simple control task. version:1

We choose to implement the actual search process as a similarity search in a visual feature space, by learning to translate a textual query into a visual representation. Searching in the visual feature space has the advantage that any update to the translation model does not require to reprocess the, typically huge, image collection on which the search is performed. We propose Text2Vis, a neural network that generates a visual representation, in the visual feature space of the fc6-fc7 layers of ImageNet, from a short descriptive text. Text2Vis optimizes two loss functions, using a stochastic loss-selection method. A visual-focused loss is aimed at learning the actual text-to-visual feature mapping, while a text-focused loss is aimed at modeling the higher-level semantic concepts expressed in language and countering the overfit on non-relevant visual components of the visual loss.

Coordinates to be optimized are usually selected randomly according to a given probability distribution. We introduce an importance sampling strategy that helps randomized coordinate descent algorithms to focus on blocks that are still far from convergence. The framework applies to problems composed of the sum of two possibly non-convex terms, one being separable and non-smooth. We have compared our algorithm to a full gradient proximal approach as well as to a randomized block coordinate algorithm that considers uniform sampling and cyclic block coordinate descent. Experimental evidences show the clear benefit of using an importance sampling strategy. version:1

We show that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and/or more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and synthetic event data. version:1

We review model selection and estimation in directed and undirected Markov models with Gaussian parametrization, emphasizing the main similarities and differences. These two model types are foundationally similar but not equivalent, as we highlight. We report existing results from a historical perspective, taking into account literature from both the artificial intelligence and statistics research communities, which first developed these models. Finally, we point out the main active research areas and open problems now existing with regard to these traditional, albeit rich, Markov models. version:1

Instead of fixing a priori the filters and their parameters using expert knowledge, we let the model find them within random draws in the (possibly infinite) space of possible filters. We define an active set feature learner that includes in the model only features that improve the classifier. To this end, we consider a fast and linear classifier, multiclass logistic classification, and show that with a good representation (the filters discovered), such a simple classifier can reach at least state of the art performances. We apply the proposed active set learner in four hyperspectral image classification problems, including agricultural and urban classification at different resolutions, as well as multimodal data. We also propose a hierarchical setting, which allows to generate more complex banks of features that can better describe the nonlinearities present in the data. version:1

Tony Cai category:stat.ME math.ST stat.ML stat.TH  published:2016-06-23 summary:We propose a general semi-supervised inference framework focused on the estimation of the population mean. We consider both the ideal semi-supervised setting where infinitely many unlabeled samples are available, as well as the ordinary semi-supervised setting in which only a finite number of unlabeled samples is available. As usual in semi-supervised settings, there exists an unlabeled sample of covariate vectors and a labeled sample consisting of covariate vectors along with real-valued responses ("labels"). Otherwise the formulation is "assumption-lean" in that no major conditions are imposed on the statistical or functional form of the data. Estimators are proposed along with corresponding confidence intervals for the population mean. Theoretical analysis on both the asymptotic behavior and $\ell_2$-risk for the proposed procedures are given. Surprisingly, the proposed estimators, based on a simple form of the least squares method, outperform the ordinary sample mean. The method is further extended to a nonparametric setting, in which the oracle rate can be achieved asymptotically. The proposed estimators are further illustrated by simulation studies and a real data example involving estimation of the homeless population. version:1

Shir, Jonathan Roslund, Amir Yehudayoff category:cs.NE cs.LG  published:2016-06-23 summary:We study the theoretical capacity to statistically learn local landscape information by Evolution Strategies (ESs). Specifically, we investigate the covariance matrix when constructed by ESs operating with the selection operator alone. We model continuous generation of candidate solutions about quadratic basins of attraction, with deterministic selection of the decision vectors that minimize the objective function values. Our goal is to rigorously show that accumulation of winning individuals carries the potential to reveal valuable information about the search landscape, e.g., as already practically utilized by derandomized ES variants. We first show that the statistically-constructed covariance matrix over such winning decision vectors shares the same eigenvectors with the Hessian matrix about the optimum. We then provide an analytic approximation of this covariance matrix for a non-elitist multi-child $(1,\lambda)$-strategy, which holds for a large population size $\lambda$. Finally, we also numerically corroborate our results. version:1

The computational efficiency of Deep CNNs as a function of their depth, allows for their use in real-time applications. One of the key issues here is to reduce the number of windows selected from images to be submitted to a Deep CNN. This is usually solved by preliminary segmentation and selection of specific windows, having outstanding "objectiveness" or other value of indicators of possible location of objects. In this paper we propose a Deep CNN approach and the general framework for recognition of objects in a real-time scenario and in an egocentric perspective. Here the window of interest is built on the basis of visual attention map computed over gaze fixations measured by a glass-worn eye-tracker. The application of this set-up is an interactive user-friendly environment for upper-limb amputees. Vision has to help the subject to control his worn neuro-prosthesis in case of a small amount of remaining muscles when the EMG control becomes unefficient. The recognition results on a specifically recorded corpus of 151 videos with simple geometrical objects show the mAP of 64,6\% and the computational time at the generalization lower than a time of a visual fixation on the object-of-interest. version:1

Despite the recent progress, the accuracy of existing methods is still not satisfactory, partially due to the difficulty of embedded high-dimensional and non-linear regression problem. Most existing discriminative methods regress the hand pose directly from a single depth image, which cannot fully utilize the depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view CNNs based approach for 3D hand pose estimation. The query depth image is projected onto multiple planes, and multi-view CNNs are trained to learn the mapping from projected images to 2D heat-maps which estimate 2D joint positions on each plane. These multi-view heat-maps are then fused to produce final 3D hand pose estimation with learned pose priors. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior than several state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. Moreover, a quantitative cross-dataset experiment and a qualitative experiment also demonstrate the good generalization ability of the proposed method. version:1

Muscinelli, Alexander Seeholzer, Johanni Brea, Wulfram Gerstner category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-23 summary:A big challenge in algorithmic composition is to devise a model that is both easily trainable and able to reproduce the long-range temporal dependencies typical of music. Here we investigate how artificial neural networks can be trained on a large corpus of melodies and turned into automated music composers able to generate new melodies coherent with the style they have been trained on. We employ gated recurrent unit networks that have been shown to be particularly efficient in learning complex sequential activations with arbitrary long time lags. Our model processes rhythm and melody in parallel while modeling the relation between these two features. Using such an approach, we were able to generate interesting complete melodies or suggest possible continuations of a melody fragment that is coherent with the characteristics of the fragment itself. version:1

People want to interact with their devices in such a way that has physical significance in the real world, in other words, they want ergonomic input devices. In this paper, we propose a new method of interaction with computing devices having a consumer grade camera, that uses two colored markers (red and green) worn on tips of the fingers to generate desired hand gestures, and for marker detection and tracking we used template matching with kalman filter. We have implemented all the usual system commands, i.e., cursor movement, right click, left click, double click, going forward and backward, zoom in and out through different hand gestures. Our system can easily recognize these gestures and give corresponding system commands. Our system is suitable for both desktop devices and devices where touch screen is not feasible like large screens or projected screens. version:1

In this context, many machine learning algorithms exist. However, the majority of the theoretical studies focus on learning with exactly two representations. In this paper, we propose a general PAC-Bayesian theory for multiview learning with more than two views. We focus our study to binary classification models that take the form of a majority vote. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds allowing to consider different relations between empirical and true risks by taking into account a notion of diversity of the voters and views, and that can be naturally extended to semi-supervised learning. version:1
arxiv-1606-07239 | Non Local Spatial and Angular Matching : Enabling higher spatial resolution diffusion MRI datasets through adaptive denoising | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07239 | id:1606.07239 author:Samuel St-Jean, Pierrick Coup√©, Maxime Descoteaux category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-23 summary:Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging datasets suffer from low Signal-to-Noise Ratio, especially at high b-values. Acquiring data at high b-values contains relevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and connectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the non-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased estimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane acceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying noise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method implemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising technique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning time. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian distributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially and angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular Matching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D overlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a dictionary of atoms is learned on those patches. A local sparse decomposition is then found by bounding the reconstruction error with the local noise variance. We compare against three other state-of-the-art denoising methods and show quantitative local and connectivity results on a synthetic phantom and on an in-vivo high resolution dataset. Overall, our method restores perceptual information, removes the noise bias in common diffusion metrics, restores the extracted peaks coherence and improves reproducibility of tractography. Our work paves the way for higher spatial resolution acquisition of diffusion MRI datasets, which could in turn reveal new anatomical details that are not discernible at the spatial resolution currently used by the diffusion MRI community. version:1

This paper addresses semantic segmentation by incorporating high-order relations and mixture of label contexts into MRF. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN to model unary terms and additional layers are devised to approximate the mean field (MF) algorithm for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that required many iterations of MF during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing models as its special cases. Furthermore, pairwise terms in DPN provide a unified framework to encode rich contextual information in high-dimensional data, such as images and videos. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up, thus enabling efficient inference. DPN is thoroughly evaluated on standard semantic image/video segmentation benchmarks, where a single DPN model yields state-of-the-art segmentation accuracies on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes dataset and CamVid dataset. version:1

Moeslund category:cs.IR cs.LG  published:2016-06-23 summary:People often use a web search engine to find information about events of interest, for example, sport competitions, political elections, festivals and entertainment news. In this paper, we study a problem of detecting event-related queries, which is the first step before selecting a suitable time-aware retrieval model. In general, event-related information needs can be observed in query streams through various temporal patterns of user search behavior, e.g., spiky peaks for popular events, and periodicities for repetitive events. However, it is also common that users search for non-popular events, which may not exhibit temporal variations in query streams, e.g., past events recently occurred, historical events triggered by anniversaries or similar events, and future events anticipated to happen. To address the challenge of detecting dynamic classes of events, we propose a novel deep learning model to classify a given query into a predetermined set of multiple event types. Our proposed model, a Stacked Multilayer Perceptron (S-MLP) network, consists of multilayer perceptron used as a basic learning unit. We assemble stacked units to further learn complex relationships between neutrons in successive layers. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct experiments using real-world queries and a set of manually created ground truth. Preliminary results have shown that our proposed deep learning model outperforms the state-of-the-art classification models significantly. version:1
arxiv-1606-07015 | Joint M-Best-Diverse Labelings as a Parametric Submodular Minimization | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07015 | id:1606.07015 author:Alexander Kirillov, Alexander Shekhovtsov, Carsten Rother, Bogdan Savchynskyy category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-22 summary:We consider the problem of jointly inferring the M-best diverse labelings for a binary (high-order) submodular energy of a graphical model. Recently, it was shown that this problem can be solved to a global optimum, for many practically interesting diversity measures. It was noted that the labelings are, so-called, nested. This nestedness property also holds for labelings of a class of parametric submodular minimization problems, where different values of the global parameter $\gamma$ give rise to different solutions. The popular example of the parametric submodular minimization is the monotonic parametric max-flow problem, which is also widely used for computing multiple labelings. As the main contribution of this work we establish a close relationship between diversity with submodular energies and the parametric submodular minimization. In particular, the joint M-best diverse labelings can be obtained by running a non-parametric submodular minimization (in the special case - max-flow) solver for M different values of $\gamma$ in parallel, for certain diversity measures. Importantly, the values for $\gamma$ can be computed in a closed form in advance, prior to any optimization. These theoretical results suggest two simple yet efficient algorithms for the joint M-best diverse problem, which outperform competitors in terms of runtime and quality of results. In particular, as we show in the paper, the new methods compute the exact M-best diverse labelings faster than a popular method of Batra et al., which in some sense only obtains approximate solutions. version:2

We answer the question in the affirmative provided our model family is well-specified. Specifically, we introduce the unanimity principle: only predict when all models consistent with the training data predict the same output. We operationalize this principle for semantic parsing, the task of mapping utterances to logical forms. We develop a simple, efficient method that reasons over the infinite set of all consistent models by only checking two of the models. We prove that our method obtains 100% precision even with a modest amount of training data from a possibly adversarial distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard GeoQuery dataset. version:2

In this context, knowledge bases (KBs) have already been acknowledged as valuable means since they allow the representation of explicit relations between entities. However, they do not necessarily represent implicit relations that could be hidden in a corpora. This latter issue is tackled by recent works dealing with deep representation learn ing of texts. With this in mind, we argue that embedding KBs within deep neural architectures supporting documentquery matching would give rise to fine-grained latent representations of both words and their semantic relations. In this paper, we review the main approaches of neural-based document ranking as well as those approaches for latent representation of entities and relations via KBs. We then propose some avenues to incorporate KBs in deep neural approaches for document ranking. More particularly, this paper advocates that KBs can be used either to support enhanced latent representations of queries and documents based on both distributional and relational semantics or to serve as a semantic translator between their latent distributional representations. version:1

Advertisers can tell their story through images, animation, text, music, video, and more, and promote that content by sponsoring it to appear as an advertisement in the streams of Tumblr users. In this paper we present a framework that enabled one of the key targeted advertising components for Tumblr, specifically gender and interest targeting. We describe the main challenges involved in development of the framework, which include creating the ground truth for training gender prediction models, as well as mapping Tumblr content to an interest taxonomy. For purposes of inferring user interests we propose a novel semi-supervised neural language model for categorization of Tumblr content (i.e., post tags and post keywords). The model was trained on a large-scale data set consisting of 6.8 billion user posts, with very limited amount of categorized keywords, and was shown to have superior performance over the bag-of-words model. We successfully deployed gender and interest targeting capability in Yahoo production systems, delivering inference for users that cover more than 90% of daily activities at Tumblr. Online performance results indicate advantages of the proposed approach, where we observed 20% lift in user engagement with sponsored posts as compared to untargeted campaigns. version:1

Link prediction is a fundamental issue to understand the mechanisms by which new links are added to the networks. We introduce the method of robust principal component analysis (robust PCA) into link prediction, and estimate the missing entries of the adjacency matrix. On one hand, our algorithm is based on the sparsity and low rank property of the matrix, on the other hand, it also performs very well when the network is dense. This is because a relatively dense real network is also sparse in comparison to the complete graph. According to extensive experiments on real networks from disparate fields, when the target network is connected and sufficiently dense, whatever it is weighted or unweighted, our method is demonstrated to be very effective and with prediction accuracy being considerably improved comparing with many state-of-the-art algorithms. version:2

More often than not, the optical elements in a 3D display are misaligned from the designed parameter setting. As a result, 3D magic does not perform well as intended. The observed images tend to get distorted. In this paper, we propose a novel display calibration method to fix the situation. In our method, a pattern image is displayed on the panel and a camera takes its pictures twice at different positions. Then, based on a quantitative model, we extract all display parameters (i.e., pitch, slanted angle, gap or thickness, offset) from the observed patterns in the captured images. For high accuracy and robustness, our method analyzes the patterns mostly in frequency domain. We conduct two types of experiments for validation; one with optical simulation for quantitative results and the other with real-life displays for qualitative assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is quite accurate, about a half order of magnitude higher than prior work; is efficient, spending less than 2 s for computation; and is robust to noise, working well in the SNR regime as low as 6 dB. version:1

We developed methodology to analyze pen stroke data from these drawings, and computed a large collection of features which were then analyzed with a variety of machine learning techniques. The resulting scoring systems were designed to be more accurate than the systems currently used by clinicians, but just as interpretable and easy to use. The systems also allow us to quantify the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.

Contrary to this fact, prior works on machine learning based Android malware detection have assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e., features) do not change over time. In this work, we address the problem of malware population drift and propose a novel online machine learning based framework, named DroidOL to handle it and effectively detect malware. In order to perform accurate detection, security-sensitive behaviors are captured from apps in the form of inter-procedural control-flow sub-graph features using a state-of-the-art graph kernel. In order to perform scalable detection and to adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online passive-aggressive classifier is used. In a large-scale comparative analysis with more than 87,000 apps, DroidOL achieves 84.29% accuracy outperforming two state-of-the-art malware techniques by more than 20% in their typical batch learning setting and more than 3% when they are continuously re-trained. Our experimental findings strongly indicate that online learning based approaches are highly suitable for real-world malware detection. version:1

An essential core of the approach is based on spectral radius of a weight-update system, and it allows stability monitoring and its maintenance at every adaptation step individually. Assuring stability of the weight-update system (at every single adaptation step) naturally results in adaptation stability of the whole neural architecture that adapts to target data. As an aside, the used approach highlights the fact that the weight optimization of HONU is a linear problem, so the proposed approach can be generally extended to any neural architecture that is linear in its adaptable parameters. version:1

Yet explanations have been shown to increase the user's trust in the system in addition to providing other benefits such as scrutability, meaning the ability to verify the validity of recommendations. This gap between accuracy and transparency or explainability has generated an interest in automated explanation generation methods. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are accurate models for CF that also lack interpretability. In this paper, we focus on RBM based collaborative filtering recommendations, and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes. We thus propose a new Explainable RBM technique that computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable. Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate and explainable recommendations. version:1

We suggest a novel visualization method that represents the SMDP model by a directed graph and visualize it above a t-SNE map. We show how can we interpret the agent's policy and give evidence for the hierarchical state aggregation that DQNs are learning automatically. Our algorithm is fully automatic, does not require any domain specific knowledge and is evaluated by a novel likelihood based evaluation criteria. version:1
arxiv-1606-07104 | Manifolds' Projective Approximation Using The Moving Least-Squares (MMLS) | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07104 | id:1606.07104 author:Barak Sober, David Levin category:cs.GR cs.LG math.DG  published:2016-06-22 summary:In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality, frequently encountered in Big Data analysis, there was a vast development in the field of linear and non-linear dimension reduction techniques in recent years. These techniques (sometimes referred to as manifold learning) assume that the scattered input data is lying on a lower dimensional manifold, thus the high dimensionality problem can be overcome by learning the lower dimensionality behavior. However, in real life applications, data is often very noisy. In this work, we propose a method to approximate a $d$-dimensional $C^{m+1}$ smooth submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ residing in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($d << n$) based upon scattered data points (i.e., a data cloud). We assume that the data points are located "near" the noisy lower dimensional manifold and perform a non-linear moving least-squares projection on an approximating manifold. Under some mild assumptions, the resulting approximant is shown to be infinitely smooth and of approximation order of $O(h^{m+1})$. Furthermore, the method presented here assumes no analytic knowledge of the approximated manifold and the approximation algorithm is linear in the large dimension $n$. version:1
arxiv-1606-07081 | Finite Sample Prediction and Recovery Bounds for Ordinal Embedding | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07081 | id:1606.07081 author:Lalit Jain, Kevin Jamieson, Robert Nowak category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-22 summary:The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints in the form of distance comparisons like "item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$". Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct constraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding with noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate the special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood estimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction errors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is non-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth, two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in experiments. version:1

To design a system that is capable of emulating human-like interactions, a conversational layer that can serve as a fabric for chat-like interaction with the agent is needed. In this paper, we introduce a model that employs Information Retrieval by utilizing convolutional deep structured semantic neural network-based features in the ranker to present human-like responses in ongoing conversation with a user. In conversations, accounting for context is critical to the retrieval model; we show that our context-sensitive approach using a Convolutional Deep Structured Semantic Model (cDSSM) with character trigrams significantly outperforms several conventional baselines in terms of the relevance of responses retrieved. version:1
arxiv-1606-07046 | Semantic Parsing to Probabilistic Programs for Situated Question Answering | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07046 | id:1606.07046 author:Jayant Krishnamurthy, Oyvind Tafjord category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-22 summary:Situated question answering is the problem of answering questions about an environment such as an image. This problem requires interpreting both a question and the environment, and is challenging because the set of interpretations is large, typically superexponential in the number of environmental objects. Existing models handle this challenge by making strong -- and untrue -- independence assumptions. We present Parsing to Probabilistic Programs (P3), a novel situated question answering model that utilizes approximate inference to eliminate these independence assumptions and enable the use of global features of the question/environment interpretation. Our key insight is to treat semantic parses as probabilistic programs that execute nondeterministically and whose possible executions represent environmental uncertainty. We evaluate our approach on a new, publicly-released data set of 5000 science diagram questions, finding that our approach outperforms several competitive baselines. version:1

Kale, Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan category:stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG  published:2016-06-22 summary:Many predictive tasks, such as diagnosing a patient based on their medical chart, are ultimately defined by the decisions of human experts. Unfortunately, encoding experts' knowledge is often time consuming and expensive. We propose a simple way to use fuzzy and informal knowledge from experts to guide discovery of interpretable latent topics in text. The underlying intuition of our approach is that latent factors should be informative about both correlations in the data and a set of relevance variables specified by an expert. Mathematically, this approach is a combination of the information bottleneck and Total Correlation Explanation (CorEx). We give a preliminary evaluation of Anchored CorEx, showing that it produces more coherent and interpretable topics on two distinct corpora. version:1

Mooij category:cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML  published:2016-06-22 summary:Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions. Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time. Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set. version:1

Lupu category:cs.CR cs.AI stat.ML  published:2016-06-22 summary:Attack graphs provide compact representations of the attack paths that an attacker can follow to compromise network resources by analysing network vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are a powerful tool for security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the estimation of the risk of compromise to the system's components given their vulnerabilities and interconnections, and accounts for multi-step attacks spreading through the system. Whilst static analysis considers the risk posture at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, e.g. from SIEM software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this paper we show how Loopy Belief Propagation - an approximate inference technique - can be applied to attack graphs, and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks. We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm's accuracy is acceptable and converge to a stable solution. We compare sequential and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages of approximate inference techniques to scale to larger attack graphs. version:1

However, the effect of the configuration used to train and generate the word embeddings on the classification performance has not been studied in the existing literature. In this paper, using a Twitter election classification task that aims to detect election-related tweets, we investigate the impact of the background dataset used to train the embedding models, the context window size and the dimensionality of word embeddings on the classification performance. By comparing the classification results of two word embedding models, which are trained using different background corpora (e.g. Wikipedia articles and Twitter microposts), we show that the background data type should align with the Twitter classification dataset to achieve a better performance. Moreover, by evaluating the results of word embeddings models trained using various context window sizes and dimensionalities, we found that large context window and dimension sizes are preferable to improve the performance. Our experimental results also show that using word embeddings and CNN leads to statistically significant improvements over various baselines such as random, SVM with TF-IDF and SVM with word embeddings. version:1

Hillar category:stat.ML cs.IT math.IT  published:2016-06-22 summary:Sparse coding or sparse dictionary learning methods have exposed underlying sparse structure in many kinds of natural data. Here, we generalize previous results guaranteeing when the learned dictionary and sparse codes are unique up to inherent permutation and scaling ambiguities. We show that these solutions are robust to the addition of measurement noise provided the data samples are sufficiently diverse. Central to our proofs is a useful lemma in combinatorial matrix theory which allows us to derive bounds on the number of samples necessary to guarantee uniqueness. We also provide probabilistic extensions to our robust identifiability theorem and an extension to the case where only an upper bound on the number of dictionary elements is known a priori. Our results help to inform the interpretation of sparse structure learned from data; whenever the conditions to one of our robust identifiability theorems are met, any sparsity-constrained algorithm that succeeds in approximately reconstructing the data well enough recovers the original dictionary and sparse codes up to an error commensurate with the noise. We discuss applications of this result to smoothed analysis, communication theory, and applied physics and engineering. version:1

The entropy has been established as a measure of this average uncertainty - also called average information content. We here use parallel texts of 21 languages to establish the number of tokens at which word entropies converge to stable values. These convergence points are then used to select texts from a massively parallel corpus, and to estimate word entropies across more than 1000 languages. Our results help to establish quantitative language comparisons, to understand the performance of multilingual translation systems, and to normalize semantic similarity measures. version:1

This paper describes further optimizations of LSTM-RNN-based SPSS for deployment on mobile devices; weight quantization, multi-frame inference, and robust inference using an {\epsilon}-contaminated Gaussian loss function.

Yet, though these systems are often dynamic, state-of-the-art methods for signal processing on graphs ignore the dimension of time, treating successive graph signals independently or taking a global average. To address this shortcoming, this paper considers the statistical analysis of time-varying graph signals. We introduce a novel definition of joint (time-vertex) stationarity, which generalizes the classical definition of time stationarity and the more recent definition appropriate for graphs. Joint stationarity gives rise to a scalable Wiener optimization framework for joint denoising, semi-supervised learning, or more generally inversing a linear operator, that is provably optimal. Experimental results on real weather data demonstrate that taking into account graph and time dimensions jointly can yield significant accuracy improvements in the reconstruction effort. version:1

However, scalability issues might prevent them from being applied to real-world problems. Exploiting parallel GAs in the cloud might be an affordable approach to get time efficient solutions that benefit of the appealing features of the cloud, such as scalability, reliability, fault-tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, distributed computation is very prone to cause considerable overhead for communication and making GAs distributed in an on-demand fashion is not trivial. Aiming to keep under control the communication overhead and support GAs developers in the construction and deployment of parallel GAs in the cloud, in this paper we propose an approach to distribute GAs using the global parallelisation model, exploiting software containers and their cloud orchestration. We also devised a conceptual workflow covering each cloud GAs distribution phase, from resources allocation to actual deployment and execution, in a DevOps fashion. version:1

The number of classes is assumed too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes. To account for this we consider a simple approach that directly approximates the likelihood. We show that this simple approach works well on toy problems and is competitive with recently introduced alternative non-likelihood based approximations. Furthermore, we relate this approach to a simple ranking objective. This leads us to suggest a specific setting for the optimal threshold in the ranking objective. version:1

Prior work in this area focuses on recognizing short, low-level activities, or gestures, and has been based on variants of hidden Markov models and conditional random fields. In contrast, we work on recognizing both gestures and longer, higher-level activites, or maneuvers, and we model the mapping from kinematics to gestures/maneuvers with recurrent neural networks. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply recurrent neural networks to this task. Using a single model and a single set of hyperparameters, we match state-of-the-art performance for gesture recognition and advance state-of-the-art performance for maneuver recognition, in terms of both accuracy and edit distance.

Early systems focused on identifying isolated recurring terms in a corpus, while more recent full-coverage systems attempt to completely segment and cluster the audio into word-like units---effectively performing unsupervised speech recognition. To our knowledge, this article presents the first such system evaluated on large-vocabulary multi-speaker data. The system uses a Bayesian modelling framework with segmental word representations: each word segment is represented as a fixed-dimensional acoustic embedding obtained by mapping the sequence of feature frames to a single embedding vector. We compare our system on English and Xitsonga datasets to state-of-the-art baselines, using a variety of measures including word error rate (obtained by mapping the unsupervised output to ground truth transcriptions). We show that by imposing a consistent top-down segmentation while also using bottom-up knowledge from detected syllable boundaries, both single-speaker and multi-speaker versions of our system outperform a purely bottom-up single-speaker syllable-based approach. We also show that the discovered clusters can be made less speaker- and gender-specific by using an unsupervised autoencoder-like feature extractor to learn better frame-level features (prior to embedding). Our system's discovered clusters are still less pure than those of two multi-speaker term discovery systems, but provide far greater coverage. version:1

To control the search space, previous work relied on restricted set of rules, which limits expressivity. In this paper, we consider a much more expressive class of logical forms, and show how to use dynamic programming to efficiently represent the complete set of consistent logical forms. Expressivity also introduces many more spurious logical forms which are consistent with the correct denotation but do not represent the meaning of the utterance. To address this, we generate fictitious worlds and use crowdsourced denotations on these worlds to filter out spurious logical forms. On the WikiTableQuestions dataset, we increase the coverage of answerable questions from 53.5% to 76%, and the additional crowdsourced supervision lets us rule out 92.1% of spurious logical forms. version:1

The advantages of the high temporal-spatial resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular. However, cloud cover is a common problem in GF-1 WFV imagery which influences its precise application. Cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only four visible and near-infrared bands. In this paper, an automatic multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC method first implements threshold segmentation based on the spectral features, and guided filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then used in combination with texture features to improve the cloud detection results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction process. The method was validated on 16 scenes randomly selected from different areas of China. The results indicate that MFC performs well under different conditions, and the average cloud classification accuracy of MFC is as high as 98.3%. When relatively compared to Fmask, MFC achieved almost the same accuracy of the cloud and cloud shadow in GF-1 WFV imagery with less spectral bands. The method proposed in this paper is developed with the goal of implementing fast and high-precision cloud and cloud shadow detection, and it will be applied to the land cover remote sensing monitoring project on a national scale. version:2

Speech enhancement or feature enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple training method called accordion annealing which is inspired by curriculum learning. It uses a multi-stage training schedule where samples at SNR values as low as -15 dB are first added and subsequently samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up to an SNR value of 50 dB. Because of the necessity of providing many different SNR valued samples, we additionally use a method called per-epoch noise mixing (PEM) to generate the noisy training samples online during training. Both the accordion annealing and the PEM methods are used during training of a recurrent neural network which is then evaluated on three databases. Accordion annealing improves the relative average accuracy of this network by 2 % when tested in a high SNR range (50 dB to 0 dB) and by 42 % in a low SNR range(-20 dB to 0 dB) on the Grid Corpus database. version:1

Instead, they usually rely a separate model fitting step to generate valid hand poses. Such a post processing is inconvenient and sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a model based deep learning approach that adopts a forward kinematics based layer to ensure the geometric validity of estimated poses. For the first time, we show that embedding such a non-linear generative process in deep learning is feasible for hand pose estimation.

Most of these problems have been inspired by major industries so that solving them, by providing either optimal or near optimal solution, was of major significance. Indeed, this was a very promising trajectory as advances in these problem-solving approaches could result in adding values to major industries. In this paper we revisit this trajectory to find out whether the attempts that started three decades ago are still aligned with the same goal, as complexities of real-world problems increased significantly. We present some examples of modern real-world problems, discuss why they might be difficult to solve, and whether there is any mismatch between these examples and the problems that are investigated in the evolutionary computation area. version:1

In this work, we propose to learn sense embeddings for the WSI task. In the training stage, our method induces several sense centroids (embedding) for each polysemous word. In the testing stage, our method represents each instance as a contextual vector, and induces its sense by finding the nearest sense centroid in the embedding space. The advantages of our method are (1) distributed sense vectors are taken as the knowledge representations which are trained discriminatively, and usually have better performance than traditional count-based distributional models, and (2) a general model for the whole vocabulary is jointly trained to induce sense centroids under the mutlitask learning framework. Evaluated on SemEval-2010 WSI dataset, our method outperforms all participants and most of the recent state-of-the-art methods. We further verify the two advantages by comparing with carefully designed baselines. version:2

However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those works, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to be contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate this drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the retrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query adaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set of base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest. Then the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the best similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and the feature pooled from a combined region. We show that the above procedure can be cast as an optimization problem and it can be solved efficiently with an off-the-shelf solver. Besides this general framework, we also propose two practical ways to create the base regions. One is based on the property of the CFM and the other one is based on a multi-scale spatial pyramid scheme. Through extensive experiments, we show that our reranking approaches bring substantial performance improvement and by applying them we can outperform the state of the art on several instance retrieval benchmarks. version:1
arxiv-1606-06793 | Scalable Support Vector Machine for Semi-supervised Learning | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06793 | id:1606.06793 author:Trung Le, Khanh Nguyen, Van Nguyen, Vu Nguyen, Dinh Phung category:cs.LG  published:2016-06-22 summary:Owing to the prevalence of unlabeled data, semisupervised learning has recently drawn significant attention and has found applicable in many real-world applications. In this paper, we present the so-called Graph-based Semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (gS3VM), a method that leverages the excellent generalization ability of kernel-based method with the geometrical and distributive information carried in a spectral graph for semi-supervised learning purpose. The proposed gS3VM can be solved directly in the primal form using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method with the ideal convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{T})$. Besides, our gS3VM allows the combinations of a wide spectrum of loss functions (e.g., Hinge, smooth Hinge, Logistic, L1, and {\epsilon}-insensitive) and smoothness functions (i.e., $l_p(t) = t ^p$ with $p\ge1$). We note that the well-known Laplacian Support Vector Machine falls into the spectrum of gS3VM corresponding to the combination of the Hinge loss and the smoothness function $l_2(.)$. We further validate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that gS3VM is appropriate for the large-scale datasets since it is optimal in memory used and yields superior classification accuracy whilst simultaneously achieving a significant computation speedup in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines. version:1
arxiv-1606-06771 | A Stackelberg Game Perspective on the Conflict Between Machine Learning and Data Obfuscation | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06771 | id:1606.06771 author:Jeffrey Pawlick, Quanyan Zhu category:cs.CR cs.LG  published:2016-06-21 summary:Data is the new oil; this refrain is repeated extensively in the age of internet tracking, machine learning, and data analytics. Social network analysis, cookie-based advertising, and government surveillance are all evidence of the use of data for commercial and national interests. Public pressure, however, is mounting for the protection of privacy. Frameworks such as differential privacy offer machine learning algorithms methods to guarantee limits to information disclosure, but they are seldom implemented. Recently, however, developers have made significant efforts to undermine tracking through obfuscation tools that hide user characteristics in a sea of noise. These services highlight an emerging clash between tracking and data obfuscation. In this paper, we conceptualize this conflict through a dynamic game between users and a machine learning algorithm that uses empirical risk minimization. First, a machine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond by choosing their own perturbation amounts. We study the interaction between the users and the learner using a Stackelberg game. The utility functions quantify accuracy using expected loss and privacy in terms of the bounds of differential privacy. In equilibrium, we find selfish users tend to cause significant utility loss to trackers by perturbing heavily, in a phenomenon reminiscent of public good games. Trackers, however, can improve the balance by proactively perturbing the data themselves. While other work in this area has studied privacy markets and mechanism design for truthful reporting of user information, we take a different viewpoint by considering both user and learner perturbation. version:1

Recruiters focus on keywords, and it's almost impossible to guarantee a fair process of candidate selection. The main scope of this paper is to tackle this issue by introducing a data-driven approach that shows how to process r\'esum\'es automatically and give recruiters more time to only examine promising candidates. Furthermore, we show how to leverage Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in order to extract all required information from the r\'esum\'es. Once the information is extracted, a ranking score is calculated. The score describes how well the candidates fit based on their education, work experience and skills. Later this paper illustrates a prototype application that shows how this novel approach can increase the productivity of recruiters. The application enables them to filter and rank candidates based on predefined job descriptions. Guided by the ranking, recruiters can get deeper insights from candidate profiles and validate why and how the application ranked them. This application shows how to improve the hiring process by giving an unbiased hiring decision support. version:2

This explains why natural languages are very poorly approximated by Markov processes. We also present a broad class of models that naturally produce critical behavior. They all involve deep dynamics of a recursive nature, as can be implemented by tree-like or recurrent deep neural networks. This model class captures the essence of recursive universal grammar as well as recursive self-reproduction in physical phenomena such as turbulence and cosmological inflation. We derive an analytic formula for the asymptotic power law and elucidate our results in a statistical physics context: 1-dimensional models (such as a Markov models) will always fail to model natural language, because they cannot exhibit phase transitions, whereas models with one or more "hidden" dimensions representing levels of abstraction or scale can potentially succeed. version:1

Rather than being trained for any specific segmentation, our framework learns the grouping process in an unsupervised manner or alongside any supervised task. By enriching the representations of a neural network, we enable it to group the representations of different objects in an iterative manner. By allowing the system to amortize the iterative inference of the groupings, we achieve very fast convergence. In contrast to many other recently proposed methods for addressing multi-object scenes, our system does not assume the inputs to be images and can therefore directly handle other modalities. For multi-digit classification of very cluttered images that require texture segmentation, our method offers improved classification performance over convolutional networks despite being fully connected. Furthermore, we observe that our system greatly improves on the semi-supervised result of a baseline Ladder network on our dataset, indicating that segmentation can also improve sample efficiency. version:1

So far, the research efforts have been focused on static graph signals. However numerous applications involve graph signals evolving in time, such as spreading or propagation of waves on a network. The analysis of this type of data requires a new set of methods that fully takes into account the time and graph dimensions. We propose a novel class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets, whose time-vertex evolution follows a dynamic process. We demonstrate that this set of functions can be combined with sparsity based approaches such as compressive sensing to reveal information on the dynamic processes occurring on a graph. Experiments on real seismological data show the efficiency of the technique, allowing to estimate the epicenter of earthquake events recorded by a seismic network. version:1

Lienkamp, Thomas Brox, Olaf Ronneberger category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-21 summary:This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases. version:1

We systematically explore a variety of neural architectures (DNN, CNN, CNNHighway, LSTM, BLSTM) to obtain character-based word vectors combined with bidirectional LSTMs to model across-word context in an end-to-end setting. We explore supplementary use of word-based vectors trained on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments for morphological tagging suggest that for "simple" model configurations, the choice of the network architecture (CNN vs. CNNHighway vs. LSTM vs. BLSTM) or the augmentation with pre-trained word embeddings can be important and clearly impact the accuracy. Increasing the model capacity by adding depth, for example, and carefully optimizing the neural networks can lead to substantial improvements, and the differences in accuracy (but not training time) become much smaller or even negligible. Overall, our best morphological taggers for German and Czech outperform the best results reported in the literature by a large margin. version:1

MI changes the way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models. version:1

Such representations have been used in a plethora of tasks, however their application in classification scenarios with thousands of classes has not been extensively researched, partially due to hardware limitations. In this work, we examine efficient composition functions to obtain document-level from word-level embeddings and we subsequently investigate their combination with the traditional one-hot-encoding representations. By presenting empirical evidence on large, multi-class, multi-label classification problems, we demonstrate the efficiency and the performance benefits of this combination. version:1

We introduce the novel problem of determining the relevance of questions to images in VQA. Current VQA models do not reason about whether a question is even related to the given image (e.g. What is the capital of Argentina?) or if it requires information from external resources to answer correctly. This can break the continuity of a dialogue in human-machine interaction. Our approaches for determining relevance are composed of two stages. Given an image and a question, (1) we first determine whether the question is visual or not, (2) if visual, we determine whether the question is relevant to the given image or not. Our approaches, based on LSTM-RNNs, VQA model uncertainty, and caption-question similarity, are able to outperform strong baselines on both relevance tasks. We also present human studies showing that VQA models augmented with such question relevance reasoning are perceived as more intelligent, reasonable, and human-like. version:1

The question of interest is to which degree both sensors i) allow the estimation of force exerted on the sensor and ii) enable the recognition of differing degrees of curvature. Making use of a force controlled linear motor affecting the tactile sensors we acquire several high-quality data sets allowing the study of both sensors under exactly the same conditions. We also examined the structure of the representation of tactile stimuli in the recorded tactile sensor data using t-SNE embeddings. The experiments show that both the iCub and the BioTac excel in different settings. version:1

However, as high-capacity supervised neural networks trained with a large amount of labels have achieved remarkable success in many computer vision tasks, the availability of large-scale labeled images reduced the significance of unsupervised learning. Inspired by the recent trend toward revisiting the importance of unsupervised learning, we investigate joint supervised and unsupervised learning in a large-scale setting by augmenting existing neural networks with decoding pathways for reconstruction. First, we demonstrate that the intermediate activations of pretrained large-scale classification networks preserve almost all the information of input images except a portion of local spatial details. Then, by end-to-end training of the entire augmented architecture with the reconstructive objective, we show improvement of the network performance for supervised tasks. We evaluate several variants of autoencoders, including the recently proposed "what-where" autoencoder that uses the encoder pooling switches, to study the importance of the architecture design. Taking the 16-layer VGGNet trained under the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 protocol as a strong baseline for image classification, our methods improve the validation-set accuracy by a noticeable margin. version:1

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI. version:1

Parameters that measure correlation between two variables are of limited utility when used with multiple variables. In this work, I propose a simple criterion to measure correlation among an arbitrary number of variables, based on a data set. The central idea is to i) design a function of the variables that can take different forms depending on a set of parameters, ii) calculate the difference between a statistics associated to the function computed on the data set and the same statistics computed on a randomised version of the data set, called "scrambled" data set, and iii) optimise the parameters to maximise this difference. Many such functions can be organised in layers, which can in turn be stacked one on top of the other, forming a neural network. The function parameters are searched with an enhanced genetic algortihm called POET and the resulting method is tested on a cancer gene data set. The method may have potential implications for some issues that affect the field of neural networks, such as overfitting, the need to process huge amounts of data for training and the presence of "adversarial examples". version:1

Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network (RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters. version:1

This paper proposes DeepWriter, a deep multi-stream CNN to learn deep powerful representation for recognizing writers. DeepWriter takes local handwritten patches as input and is trained with softmax classification loss. The main contributions are: 1) we design and optimize multi-stream structure for writer identification task; 2) we introduce data augmentation learning to enhance the performance of DeepWriter; 3) we introduce a patch scanning strategy to handle text image with different lengths. In addition, we find that different languages such as English and Chinese may share common features for writer identification, and joint training can yield better performance. Experimental results on IAM and HWDB datasets show that our models achieve high identification accuracy: 99.01% on 301 writers and 97.03% on 657 writers with one English sentence input, 93.85% on 300 writers with one Chinese character input, which outperform previous methods with a large margin. Moreover, our models obtain accuracy of 98.01% on 301 writers with only 4 English alphabets as input. version:1

Shi category:q-bio.NC cs.NE  published:2016-06-21 summary:Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is an involuntary eye movement responsible for stabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an observer and the environment. Fully understanding the development of optokinetic nystagmus requires a neurally plausible computational model that accounts for the neural development and the behavior. To date, work in this area has been limited. We propose a neurally plausible framework for the joint development of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the optokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint emergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of the development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving normal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we can simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as artificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively and quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both binocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also makes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods used to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature. version:1

However, the state of the art, based on total variation or graph-net, is computationally costly. Here we introduce sparsity in the local neighborhood of each voxel with social-sparsity, a structured shrinkage operator. We find that, on brain imaging classification problems, social-sparsity performs almost as well as total-variation models and better than graph-net, for a fraction of the computational cost. It also very clearly outlines predictive regions. We give details of the model and the algorithm. version:1

Facades of buildings are highly structured and consequently most methods that have been proposed for this problem aim to make use of this strong prior information. Contrary to most prior work, we are describing a system that is almost domain independent and consists of standard segmentation methods. We train a sequence of boosted decision trees using auto-context features. This is learned using stacked generalization.

To this end, we propose a topic augmented joint attention based Seq2Seq (TAJA-Seq2Seq) model. In TAJA-Seq2Seq, information from input posts and information from topics related to the posts are simultaneously embedded into vector spaces by a content encoder and a topic encoder respectively. The two kinds of information interact with each other and help calibrate weights of each other in the joint attention mechanism in TAJA2Seq2Seq, and jointly determine the generation of responses in decoding. The model simulates how people behave in conversation and can generate well-focused and informative responses with the help of topic information. Empirical study on large scale human judged generation results show that our model outperforms Seq2Seq with attention on both response quality and diversity. version:1

Jonnalagadda category:cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG  published:2016-06-21 summary:A systematic review identifies and collates various clinical studies and compares data elements and results in order to provide an evidence based answer for a particular clinical question. The process is manual and involves lot of time. A tool to automate this process is lacking. The aim of this work is to develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision (27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic data extraction from biomedical research publications. The future scope of this work is to generalize this information framework for all types of systematic reviews. version:1
arxiv-1606-06406 | Incremental Parsing with Minimal Features Using Bi-Directional LSTM | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06406 | id:1606.06406 author:James Cross, Liang Huang category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-21 summary:Recently, neural network approaches for parsing have largely automated the combination of individual features, but still rely on (often a larger number of) atomic features created from human linguistic intuition, and potentially omitting important global context. To further reduce feature engineering to the bare minimum, we use bi-directional LSTM sentence representations to model a parser state with only three sentence positions, which automatically identifies important aspects of the entire sentence. This model achieves state-of-the-art results among greedy dependency parsers for English. We also introduce a novel transition system for constituency parsing which does not require binarization, and together with the above architecture, achieves state-of-the-art results among greedy parsers for both English and Chinese. version:1
arxiv-1606-05854 | Full-Time Supervision based Bidirectional RNN for Factoid Question Answering | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05854 | id:1606.05854 author:Dong Xu, Wu-Jun Li category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-19 summary:Recently, bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) has been widely used for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance. However, most existing BRNN models extract the information of questions and answers by directly using a pooling operation to generate the representation for loss or similarity calculation. Hence, these existing models don't put supervision (loss or similarity calculation) at every time step, which will lose some useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision at every time step. Experiments on the factoid QA task show that our FTS-BRNN can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy. version:2
arxiv-1606-06377 | Kernel-based Generative Learning in Distortion Feature Space | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06377 | id:1606.06377 author:Bo Tang, Paul M. Baggenstoss, Haibo He category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-21 summary:This paper presents a novel kernel-based generative classifier which is defined in a distortion subspace using polynomial series expansion, named Kernel-Distortion (KD) classifier. An iterative kernel selection algorithm is developed to steadily improve classification performance by repeatedly removing and adding kernels. The experimental results on character recognition application not only show that the proposed generative classifier performs better than many existing classifiers, but also illustrate that it has different recognition capability compared to the state-of-the-art discriminative classifier - deep belief network. The recognition diversity indicates that a hybrid combination of the proposed generative classifier and the discriminative classifier could further improve the classification performance. Two hybrid combination methods, cascading and stacking, have been implemented to verify the diversity and the improvement of the proposed classifier. version:1
arxiv-1606-06369 | Contextual Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernel For Malware Detection | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06369 | id:1606.06369 author:Annamalai Narayanan, Guozhu Meng, Liu Yang, Jinliang Liu, Lihui Chen category:cs.CR cs.LG  published:2016-06-21 summary:In this paper, we propose a novel graph kernel specifically to address a challenging problem in the field of cyber-security, namely, malware detection. Previous research has revealed the following: (1) Graph representations of programs are ideally suited for malware detection as they are robust against several attacks, (2) Besides capturing topological neighbourhoods (i.e., structural information) from these graphs it is important to capture the context under which the neighbourhoods are reachable to accurately detect malicious neighbourhoods. We observe that state-of-the-art graph kernels, such as Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WLK) capture the structural information well but fail to capture contextual information. To address this, we develop the Contextual Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (CWLK) which is capable of capturing both these types of information. We show that for the malware detection problem, CWLK is more expressive and hence more accurate than WLK while maintaining comparable efficiency. Through our large-scale experiments with more than 50,000 real-world Android apps, we demonstrate that CWLK outperforms two state-of-the-art graph kernels (including WLK) and three malware detection techniques by more than 5.27% and 4.87% F-measure, respectively, while maintaining high efficiency. This high accuracy and efficiency make CWLK suitable for large-scale real-world malware detection. version:1

Unlike most existing feature selection approaches, the proposed FSMJ approach is based on real-valued features which provide more information for discrimination than binary-valued features used in conventional approaches. We show that the FSMJ is a greedy approach and the JS-divergence monotonically increases when more features are selected. We conduct several experiments on real-life data sets, compared with the state-of-the-art feature selection approaches for text categorization. The superior performance of the proposed FSMJ approach demonstrates its effectiveness and further indicates its wide potential applications on data mining. version:1

Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. Here, we describe initial efforts to model student dropout using the largest known dataset on higher education attrition, which tracks over 32,500 students' demographics and transcript records at one of the nation's largest public universities. Our results highlight several early indicators of student attrition and show that dropout can be accurately predicted even when predictions are based on a single term of academic transcript data. These results highlight the potential for machine learning to have an impact on student retention and success while pointing to several promising directions for future work. version:1
arxiv-1606-06361 | A Probabilistic Generative Grammar for Semantic Parsing | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06361 | id:1606.06361 author:Abulhair Saparov, Tom M. Mitchell category:cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML  published:2016-06-20 summary:We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of natural language sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parser that jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representations of a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate a sentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior, such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semantic statement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence. A joint semantic-syntactic parser is derived that returns the $k$-best semantic and syntactic parses for a given sentence. The semantic prior is flexible, and can be used to incorporate background knowledge during parsing, in ways unlike previous semantic parsing approaches. For example, semantic statements corresponding to beliefs in a knowledge base can be given higher prior probability, type-correct statements can be given somewhat lower probability, and beliefs outside the knowledge base can be given lower probability. The construction of our grammar invokes a novel application of hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs), which in turn, requires a novel and efficient inference approach. We present experimental results showing, for a simple grammar, that our parser outperforms a state-of-the-art CCG semantic parser and scales to knowledge bases with millions of beliefs. version:1

As in previous studies, we propose to solve this problem through latent factorization. However, here we make use of complex valued embeddings. The composition of complex embeddings can handle a large variety of binary relations, among them symmetric and antisymmetric relations. Compared to state-of-the-art models such as Neural Tensor Network and Holographic Embeddings, our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simpler, as it only uses the Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors. Our approach is scalable to large datasets as it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks. version:1

One method uses in-text annotations to illustrate a model's view of particular tokens in particular documents. Another uses a high-level, "words-as-pixels" graphic to display an entire corpus. Together, these methods offer both zoomed-in and zoomed-out perspectives into a model's understanding of text. We show how these interconnected methods help diagnose a classifier's poor performance on Twitter slang, and make sense of a topic model on historical political texts. version:1

However existing sources for this data are lacking in various ways; difficult to access, biased, have poor geographical or temporal resolution, or are significantly delayed. In this paper, we describe how geolocation data from Twitter can be used to estimate global mobility patterns and address these shortcomings. These findings will inform how this novel data source can be harnessed to address humanitarian and development efforts. version:1
arxiv-1606-06314 | Colorization for Image Compression | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06314 | id:1606.06314 author:Mohammad Haris Baig, Lorenzo Torresani category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-20 summary:In this work we focus on the problem of colorization for image compression. Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale version can produce dramatic reduction in image file size. But colorization for compression poses several challenges. First, while colorization for artistic purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to the ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple possible colors. Thus, to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy. To account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep tree-structured network that generates multiple color hypotheses for every pixel from a grayscale picture (as opposed to a single color produced by most prior colorization approaches). We show how to leverage the multimodal output of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by storing very little additional information. In the experiments we show that our proposed method outperforms traditional JPEG color coding by a large margin, producing colors that are nearly indistinguishable from the ground truth at the storage cost of just a few hundred bytes for high-resolution pictures! version:1
arxiv-1606-06274 | A Data-Driven Approach for Semantic Role Labeling from Induced Grammar Structures in Language | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06274 | id:1606.06274 author:Vivek Datla, David Lin, Max Louwerse, Abhinav Vishnu category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-20 summary:Semantic roles play an important role in extracting knowledge from text. Current unsupervised approaches utilize features from grammar structures, to induce semantic roles. The dependence on these grammars, however, makes it difficult to adapt to noisy and new languages. In this paper we develop a data-driven approach to identifying semantic roles, the approach is entirely unsupervised up to the point where rules need to be learned to identify the position the semantic role occurs. Specifically we develop a modified-ADIOS algorithm based on ADIOS Solan et al. (2005) to learn grammar structures, and use these grammar structures to learn the rules for identifying the semantic roles based on the context in which the grammar structures appeared. The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-art models that are inherently dependent on human annotated data. version:1

In this paper, we apply fully-convolutional deep neural networks to the tasks of detecting and tracking liquids. We evaluate three models: a single-frame network, multi-frame network, and a LSTM recurrent network. Our results show that the best liquid detection results are achieved when aggregating data over multiple frames, in contrast to standard image segmentation. They also show that the LSTM network outperforms the other two in both tasks. This suggests that LSTM-based neural networks have the potential to be a key component for enabling robots to handle liquids using robust, closed-loop controllers. version:1

Studying sentiment and subjectivity in these opinion videos is experiencing a growing attention from academia and industry. While sentiment analysis has been successful for text, it is an understudied research question for videos and multimedia content. The biggest setbacks for studies in this direction are lack of a proper dataset, methodology, baselines and statistical analysis of how information from different modality sources relate to each other. This paper introduces to the scientific community the first opinion-level annotated corpus of sentiment and subjectivity analysis in online videos called Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset (MOSI). The dataset is rigorously annotated with labels for subjectivity, sentiment intensity, per-frame and per-opinion annotated visual features, and per-milliseconds annotated audio features. Furthermore, we present baselines for future studies in this direction as well as a new multimodal fusion approach that jointly models spoken words and visual gestures. version:1

We assume that the samples are provided by some valid Monte Carlo procedure, so we are guaranteed that the collection of samples will asymptotically approximate the true distribution. Most current evaluation approaches focus on two questions: (1) Has the chain mixed, that is, is it sampling from the distribution? and (2) How independent are the samples (as MCMC procedures produce correlated samples)? Focusing on the case of Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization, we empirically evaluate standard metrics of sampler quality as well as propose new metrics to capture aspects that these measures fail to expose. The aspect of sampling that is of particular interest to us is the ability (or inability) of sampling methods to move between multiple optima in NMF problems. As a proxy, we propose and study a number of metrics that might quantify the diversity of a set of NMF factorizations obtained by a sampler through quantifying the coverage of the posterior distribution. We compare the performance of a number of standard sampling methods for NMF in terms of these new metrics. version:1
arxiv-1606-06244 | Fast Convergence of Common Learning Algorithms in Games | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06244 | id:1606.06244 author:Dylan J. Foster, Zhiyuan Li, Thodoris Lykouris, Karthik Sridharan, Eva Tardos category:cs.GT cs.LG  published:2016-06-20 summary:We show that learning algorithms satisfying a $\textit{low approximate regret}$ property experience fast convergence to approximate optimality in a large class of repeated games. Our property, which simply requires that each learner has small regret compared to a $(1+\epsilon)$-multiplicative approximation to the best action in hindsight, is ubiquitous among learning algorithms - it is satisfied even by the vanilla Hedge forecaster. Our results improve upon recent work of Syrgkanis et al. [SALS15] in a number of ways. We improve upon the speed of convergence by a factor of n, the number of players, and require only that the players observe payoffs under other players' realized actions, as opposed to expected payoffs. We further show that convergence occurs with high probability, and under certain conditions show convergence under bandit feedback. Both the scope of settings and the class of algorithms for which our analysis provides fast convergence are considerably broader than in previous work. Our framework applies to dynamic population games via a low approximate regret property for shifting experts. Here we strengthen the results of Lykouris et al. [LST16] in two ways: We allow players to select learning algorithms from a larger class, which includes a minor variant of the basic Hedge algorithm, and we increase the maximum churn in players for which approximate optimality is achieved. In the bandit setting we present a novel algorithm which provides a "small loss"-type bound with improved dependence on the number of actions and is both simple and efficient. This result may be of independent interest. version:1

In this paper, we resolve many of the key algorithmic questions regarding robustness, memory efficiency, and differential privacy of tensor decomposition. We propose simple variants of the tensor power method which enjoy these strong properties. We present the first guarantees for online tensor power method which has a linear memory requirement. Moreover, we present a noise calibrated tensor power method with efficient privacy guarantees. At the heart of all these guarantees lies a careful perturbation analysis derived in this paper which improves up on the existing results significantly. version:1

Existing high-level parallel abstractions like MapReduce are insufficiently expressive while low-level tools like MPI and Pthreads leave ML experts repeatedly solving the same design challenges. However, the diversity and large-scale data size have posed a significant challenge to construct a flexible and high-performance implementation of deep learning neural networks. To improve the performance and maintain the scalability, we present CNNLab, a novel deep learning framework using GPU and FPGA-based accelerators. CNNLab provides a uniform programming model to users so that the hardware implementation and the scheduling are invisible to the programmers. At runtime, CNNLab leverages the trade-offs between GPU and FPGA before offloading the tasks to the accelerators. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art Nvidia K40 GPU and Altera DE5 FPGA board demonstrate that the CNNLab can provide a universal framework with efficient support for diverse applications without increasing the burden of the programmers. Moreover, we analyze the detailed quantitative performance, throughput, power, energy, and performance density for both approaches. Experimental results leverage the trade-offs between GPU and FPGA and provide useful practical experiences for the deep learning research community. version:1
arxiv-1606-06216 | Neural networks with differentiable structure | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06216 | id:1606.06216 author:Thomas Miconi category:cs.NE  published:2016-06-20 summary:While gradient descent has proven highly successful in learning connection weights for neural networks, the actual structure of these networks is usually determined by hand, or by other optimization algorithms. Here we describe a simple method to make network structure differentiable, and therefore accessible to gradient descent. We test this method on recurrent neural networks applied to simple sequence prediction problems. Starting with initial networks containing only one node, the method automatically builds networks that successfully solve the tasks. The number of nodes in the final network correlates with task difficulty. The method can dynamically increase network size in response to an abrupt complexification in the task; however, reduction in network size in response to task simplification is not evident for reasonable meta-parameters. The method does not penalize network performance for these test tasks: variable-size networks actually reach better performance than fixed-size networks of higher, lower or identical size. We conclude by discussing how this method could be applied to more complex networks, such as feedforward layered networks, or multiple-area networks of arbitrary shape. version:1

Dalalyan, Edwin Grappin, Quentin Paris category:math.ST stat.ML stat.TH  published:2016-06-20 summary:In this paper we revisit the risk bounds of the lasso estimator in the context of transductive and semi-supervised learning. In other terms, the setting under consideration is that of regression with random design under partial labeling. The main goal is to obtain user-friendly bounds on the off-sample prediction risk. To this end, the simple setting of bounded response variable and bounded (high-dimensional) covariates is considered. We propose some new adaptations of the lasso to these settings and establish oracle inequalities both in expectation and in deviation. These results provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the risk that highlight the interplay between the bias due to the mis-specification of the linear model, the bias due to the approximate sparsity and the variance. They also demonstrate that the presence of a large number of unlabeled features may have significant positive impact in the situations where the restricted eigenvalue of the design matrix vanishes or is very small. version:1

In particular, during backward pass, parameter gradients are stochastically quantized to low bitwidth numbers before being propagated to convolutional layers. As convolutions during forward/backward passes can now operate on low bitwidth weights and activations/gradients respectively, DoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate both training and inference. Moreover, as bit convolutions can be efficiently implemented on CPU, FPGA, ASIC and GPU, DoReFatNet opens the way to accelerate training of low bitwidth neural network on these hardware. Our experiments on SVHN and ImageNet datasets prove that DoReFa-Net can achieve comparable prediction accuracy as 32-bit counterparts. For example, a DoReFa-Net derived from AlexNet that has 1-bit weights, 2-bit activations, can be trained from scratch using 4-bit gradients to get 47\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet validation set. The DoReFa-Net AlexNet model is released publicly. version:1

In most of the cases, the tags on a given item are free words chosen by the authors independently. Therefore, relations among keywords in a collection of news items is unknown. However, in most cases the topics and concepts described by these keywords are forming a latent hierarchy, with the more general topics and categories at the top, and more specialised ones at the bottom. Here we apply a recent, cooccurrence-based tag hierarchy extraction method to sets of keywords obtained from four different on-line news portals. The resulting hierarchies show substantial differences not just in the topics rendered as important (being at the top of the hierarchy) or of less interest (categorised low in the hierarchy), but also in the underlying network structure. This reveals discrepancies between the plausible keyword association frameworks in the studied news portals. version:1

Examples include the reconstruction of neural or vascular structures under connectedness constraints. We discuss the minimum cost connected subgraph (MCCS) problem and its approximations from the perspective of medical applications. We propose a) objective-dependent constraints and b) novel constraint generation schemes to solve this optimization problem exactly by means of a branch-and-cut algorithm. These are shown to improve scalability and allow us to solve instances of two medical benchmark datasets to optimality for the first time. This enables us to perform a quantitative comparison between exact and approximative algorithms, where we identify the geodesic tree algorithm as an excellent alternative to exact inference on the examined datasets. version:1

W. Pluim category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-20 summary:The size of nuclei in histological preparations from excised breast tumors is predictive of patient outcome (large nuclei indicate poor outcome). Pathologists take into account nuclear size when performing breast cancer grading. In addition, the mean nuclear area (MNA) has been shown to have independent prognostic value. The straightforward approach to measuring nuclear size is by performing nuclei segmentation. We hypothesize that given an image of a tumor region with known nuclei locations, the area of the individual nuclei and region statistics such as the MNA can be reliably computed directly from the image data by employing a machine learning model, without the intermediate step of nuclei segmentation. Towards this goal, we train a deep convolutional neural network model that is applied locally at each nucleus location, and can reliably measure the area of the individual nuclei and the MNA. Furthermore, we show how such an approach can be extended to perform combined nuclei detection and measurement, which is reminiscent of granulometry. version:1
arxiv-1606-06126 | High Confidence Off-Policy Evaluation with Models | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06126 | id:1606.06126 author:Josiah P. Hanna, Peter Stone, Scott Niekum category:cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML  published:2016-06-20 summary:In many reinforcement learning applications executing a poor policy may be costly or even dangerous. Thus, it is desirable to determine confidence interval lower bounds on the performance of any given policy without executing said policy. Current methods for high confidence off-policy evaluation require a substantial amount of data to achieve a tight lower bound, while existing model-based methods only address the problem in discrete state spaces. We propose two bootstrapping approaches combined with learned MDP transition models in order to efficiently estimate lower confidence bounds on policy performance with limited data in both continuous and discrete state spaces. Since direct use of a model may introduce bias, we derive a theoretical upper bound on model bias when we estimate the model transitions with i.i.d. sampled trajectories. This bound can be used to guide selection between the two methods. Finally, we empirically validate the data-efficiency of our proposed methods across three domains and analyze the settings where one method is preferable to the other. version:1

It was previously observed that the lambda terms and/or the denotations studied tend to follow the same pattern: they are instances of a monad. In this paper, we present an extension of the simply-typed lambda calculus that exploits this uniformity using the recently discovered technique of effect handlers. We prove that our calculus exhibits some of the key formal properties of the lambda calculus and we use it to construct a modular semantics for a small fragment that involves multiple distinct semantic phenomena. version:1

If the input data reflects stereotypes and biases of the broader society, then the output of the learning algorithm also captures these stereotypes. In this paper, we initiate the study of gender stereotypes in {\em word embedding}, a popular framework to represent text data. As their use becomes increasingly common, applications can inadvertently amplify unwanted stereotypes. We show across multiple datasets that the embeddings contain significant gender stereotypes, especially with regard to professions. We created a novel gender analogy task and combined it with crowdsourcing to systematically quantify the gender bias in a given embedding. We developed an efficient algorithm that reduces gender stereotype using just a handful of training examples while preserving the useful geometric properties of the embedding. We evaluated our algorithm on several metrics. While we focus on male/female stereotypes, our framework may be applicable to other types of embedding biases. version:1

Thus, it is critical to build an efficient embedding of images and texts. We implement DualNet, which fully takes advantage of discriminative power of both image and textual features by separately performing two operations. Building an ensemble of DualNet further boosts the performance. Contrary to common belief, our method proved effective in both real images and abstract scenes, in spite of significantly different properties of respective domain. Our method was able to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in real images category even without explicitly employing attention mechanism, and also outperformed our own state-of-the-art method in abstract scenes category, which recently won the first place in VQA Challenge 2016. version:1

However, it is not clear to which extent this similarity value can be genuinely meaningful and useful for subsequent tasks. We explore how the similarity score obtained from the models is really indicative of term relatedness. We first observe and quantify the uncertainty factor of the word embedding models regarding to the similarity value. Based on this factor, we introduce a general threshold on various dimensions which effectively filters the highly related terms. Our evaluation on four information retrieval collections supports the effectiveness of our approach as the results of the introduced threshold are significantly better than the baseline while being equal to or statistically indistinguishable from the optimal results. version:1

For efficient product classification we require a suitable representation for a document (the textual description of a product) feature vector and efficient and fast algorithms for prediction. To address the above challenges, we propose a new distributional semantics representation for document vector formation. We also develop a new two-level ensemble approach utilizing (with respect to the taxonomy tree) a path-wise, node-wise and depth-wise classifiers for error reduction in the final product classification. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the distributional representation and the ensemble approach on data sets from a leading e-commerce platform and achieve better results on various evaluation metrics compared to earlier approaches. version:1

However related analysis becomes more and more difficult as the learner's structure turns large and complex. This paper makes a preliminary step towards a new direction. We extract a local component of a large neuron system, and defines its relative Fisher information metric that describes accurately this small component, and is invariant to the other parts of the system. This concept is important because the geometry structure is much simplified and it can be easily applied to guide the learning of neural networks. We provide an analysis on a list of commonly used components, and demonstrate how to use this concept to further improve optimization. version:1

P. van der Aalst category:cs.DB cs.LG  published:2016-06-20 summary:In this paper we describe a method to discover frequent behavioral patterns in event logs. We express these patterns as \emph{local process models}. Local process model mining can be positioned in-between process discovery and episode / sequential pattern mining. The technique presented in this paper is able to learn behavioral patterns involving sequential composition, concurrency, choice and loop, like in process mining. However, we do not look at start-to-end models, which distinguishes our approach from process discovery and creates a link to episode / sequential pattern mining. We propose an incremental procedure for building local process models capturing frequent patterns based on so-called process trees. We propose five quality dimensions and corresponding metrics for local process models, given an event log. We show monotonicity properties for some quality dimensions, enabling a speedup of local process model discovery through pruning. We demonstrate through a real life case study that mining local patterns allows us to get insights in processes where regular start-to-end process discovery techniques are only able to learn unstructured, flower-like, models. version:1

However, in most of the cases either the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is colossal or an insufficient number of samples have been taken for verification. The present work proposes a Genetic Algorithm based technique for cryptanalysis of knapsack cipher. The experiments conducted prove the validity of the technique. The results prove that the technique is better than the existing techniques. An extensive review has been carried out in order to find the gaps in the existing techniques. The work paves the way of the application of computational intelligence techniques to the discipline of cryptanalysis. version:1

Lucas category:cs.AI cs.NE I.2.8  published:2016-06-20 summary:The Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm is a direct search technique mostly used in discrete domains. It repeats the process of randomly selecting a neighbour of a best-so-far solution and accepts the neighbour if it is better than or equal to it. In this work, we propose to use a novel method to select the neighbour solution using a set of independent multi- armed bandit-style selection units which results in a bandit-based Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm. The new algorithm significantly outperforms Random Mutation Hill-Climbing in both OneMax (in noise-free and noisy cases) and Royal Road problems (in the noise-free case). The algorithm shows particular promise for discrete optimisation problems where each fitness evaluation is expensive. version:1

LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text. version:1

The orientation field (OF) plays an important role at various processing stages in fingerprint recognition systems. OFs are used for image enhancement, fingerprint alignment, for fingerprint liveness detection, fingerprint alteration detection and fingerprint matching. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to globally model an OF combined with locally adaptive methods. We show that this model adapts perfectly to the 'true OF' in the limit. This perfect OF is described by a small number of parameters with straightforward geometric interpretation. Applications are manifold: Quick expert marking of very poor quality (for instance latent) OFs, high fidelity low parameter OF compression and a direct road to ground truth OFs markings for large databases, say. In this contribution we describe an algorithm to perfectly estimate OF parameters automatically or semi-automatically, depending on image quality, and we establish the main underlying claim of high fidelity low parameter OF compression. version:1

It has been recently proposed that the CNL approach could be scaled up, building on the concept of embedded CNL and, thus, allowing for CNL-based information extraction from e.g. normative or medical texts that are rather controlled by nature but still infringe the boundaries of CNL. Although it is arguable if CNL can be exploited to approach the robust wide-coverage semantic parsing for use cases like media monitoring, its potential becomes much more obvious in the opposite direction: generation of story highlights from the summarized AMR graphs, which is in the focus of this position paper. version:1

We propose a criterion that provides a series of orthogonal directional vectors, that form a basis for dimension reduction. The proposed method can be thought of as an extension from the continuum regression, and the resulting basis is called continuum directions. We show that these directions continuously bridge the principal component, mean difference and linear discriminant directions, thus ranging from unsupervised to fully supervised dimension reduction. With a presence of binary supervision data, the proposed directions can be directly used for a two-group classification. Numerical studies show that the proposed method works well in high-dimensional settings where the variance of the first principal component is much larger than the rest. version:1

Mostofa Ali Patwary, Ankit Agrawal, Alok Choudhary category:cs.DS cs.CV cs.PF  published:2016-06-20 summary:Connected Component Labeling (CCL) is an important step in pattern recognition and image processing. It assigns labels to the pixels such that adjacent pixels sharing the same features are assigned the same label. Typically, CCL requires several passes over the data. We focus on two-pass technique where each pixel is given a provisional label in the first pass whereas an actual label is assigned in the second pass. We present a scalable parallel two-pass CCL algorithm, called PAREMSP, which employs a scan strategy and the best union-find technique called REMSP, which uses REM's algorithm for storing label equivalence information of pixels in a 2-D image. In the first pass, we divide the image among threads and each thread runs the scan phase along with REMSP simultaneously. In the second phase, we assign the final labels to the pixels. As REMSP is easily parallelizable, we use the parallel version of REMSP for merging the pixels on the boundary. Our experiments show the scalability of PAREMSP achieving speedups up to $20.1$ using $24$ cores on shared memory architecture using OpenMP for an image of size $465.20$ MB. We find that our proposed parallel algorithm achieves linear scaling for a large resolution fixed problem size as the number of processing elements are increased. Additionally, the parallel algorithm does not make use of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable. version:1

However, these approaches do not translate well to low resourced languages where large amounts of training data is not available. For such languages, automatic discovery of acoustic units is critical. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of nonparametric Bayesian models to acoustic unit discovery. We show that the discovered units are correlated with phonemes and therefore are linguistically meaningful. We also present a spoken term detection (STD) by example query algorithm based on these automatically learned units. We show that our proposed system produces a P@N of 61.2% and an EER of 13.95% on the TIMIT dataset. The improvement in the EER is 5% while P@N is only slightly lower than the best reported system in the literature. version:1

ELM is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as \textbf{DivTopkshapelets}\ is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets. Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as \textbf{DivShapELM} to automatically determine the k value, which is further utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. version:1

In this paper, we propose to apply a novel method, namely Hybrid Orthogonal Projection and Estimation (HOPE), to CNNs in order to introduce orthogonality into the CNN structure. The HOPE model can be viewed as a hybrid model to combine feature extraction using orthogonal linear projection with mixture models. It is an effective model to extract useful information from the original high-dimension feature vectors and meanwhile filter out irrelevant noises. In this work, we present two different ways to apply the HOPE models to CNNs, i.e., {\em HOPE-Input} and {\em HOPE-Pooling}. For {\em HOPE-Input}, a HOPE layer is directly used right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors. Alternatively, in {\em HOPE-Pooling}, a HOPE layer is used to replace the regular pooling layer in CNNs. The experimental results on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets have shown that the orthogonal contraints imposed by the HOPE layers can significantly improve the performance of CNNs in these image classification tasks (we have achieved top-3 performance when image augmentation has not been applied). version:1

Rose category:stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG  published:2016-06-19 summary:Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of acoustic modeling tasks in recent years. These include the applications of DNNs either in a discriminative feature extraction or in a hybrid acoustic modeling scenario. Despite the rapid progress in this area, a number of challenges remain in training DNNs. This paper presents an effective way of training DNNs using a manifold learning based regularization framework. In this framework, the parameters of the network are optimized to preserve underlying manifold based relationships between speech feature vectors while minimizing a measure of loss between network outputs and targets. This is achieved by incorporating manifold based locality constraints in the objective criterion of DNNs. Empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that training a network with manifold constraints preserves structural compactness in the hidden layers of the network. Manifold regularization is applied to train bottleneck DNNs for feature extraction in hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition. The experiments in this work are conducted on the Aurora-2 spoken digits and the Aurora-4 read news large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. The performance is measured in terms of word error rate (WER) on these tasks. It is shown that the manifold regularized DNNs result in up to 37% reduction in WER relative to standard DNNs. version:1

Blaschko category:cs.LG cs.DM  published:2016-06-19 summary:Slack and margin rescaling are variants of the structured output SVM. They define convex surrogates to task specific loss functions, which, when specialized to non-additive loss functions for multi-label problems, yield extensions to increasing set functions. We demonstrate in this paper that we may use these concepts to define polynomial time convex extensions of arbitrary supermodular functions. We further show that slack and margin rescaling can be interpreted as dominating convex extensions over multiplicative and additive families, and that margin rescaling is strictly dominated by slack rescaling. However, we also demonstrate that, while the function value and gradient for margin rescaling can be computed in polynomial time, the same for slack rescaling corresponds to a non-supermodular maximization problem. version:1

The original algorithm transforms an image to have the style of another given image. For example, a photograph can be transformed to have the style of a famous painting.

Adams, Charles Sutton category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-19 summary:A good clustering can help a data analyst to explore and understand a data set, but what constitutes a good clustering may depend on domain-specific and application-specific criteria. These criteria can be difficult to formalize, even when it is easy for an analyst to know a good clustering when they see one. We present a new approach to interactive clustering for data exploration called TINDER, based on a particularly simple feedback mechanism, in which an analyst can reject a given clustering and request a new one, which is chosen to be different from the previous clustering while fitting the data well. We formalize this interaction in a Bayesian framework as a method for prior elicitation, in which each different clustering is produced by a prior distribution that is modified to discourage previously rejected clusterings. We show that TINDER successfully produces a diverse set of clusterings, each of equivalent quality, that are much more diverse than would be obtained by randomized restarts. version:1

Minimizing the $\ell_1$-norm is among the more popular approaches for compressed sensing. A recent paper by Cai and Zhang has provided the "best possible" bounds for $\ell_1$-norm minimization to achieve robust sparse recovery (a formal statement of compressed sensing). In some applications, "group sparsity" is more natural than conventional sparsity. In this paper we present sufficient conditions for $\ell_1$-norm minimization to achieve robust group sparse recovery. When specialized to conventional sparsity, these conditions reduce to the known "best possible" bounds proved earlier by Cai and Zhang. This is achieved by stating and proving a group robust null space property, which is a new result even for conventional sparsity. We also derive bounds for the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error between the true vector and its approximation, for all $p \in [1,2]$. These bounds are new even for conventional sparsity and of course also for group sparsity, because previously error bounds were available only for the $\ell_2$-norm. version:1

Since the Kullback-Leibler divergence of mixtures does not admit closed-form formula, it is in practice either estimated using costly Monte-Carlo stochastic integration or approximated using various techniques. We present a fast and generic method that builds algorithmically closed-form lower and upper bounds on the entropy, the cross-entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence of mixtures. We illustrate the versatile method by reporting on our experiments for approximating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between univariate exponential mixtures, Gaussian mixtures and Rayleigh mixtures. version:1

In conventional deep neural network based speech synthesis, the input text features are repeated for the entire duration of phoneme for mapping text and speech parameters. This mapping is learnt at the frame-level which is the de-facto acoustic representation. However much of this computational requirement can be drastically reduced if every unit can be represented with a fixed-dimensional representation. Using recurrent neural network based auto-encoder, we show that it is indeed possible to map units of varying duration to a single vector. We then use this acoustic representation at unit-level to synthesize speech using deep neural network based statistical parametric speech synthesis technique. Results show that the proposed approach is able to synthesize at the same quality as the conventional frame based approach at a highly reduced computational cost. version:1

However, artistic activities such as poem generation are still widely regarded as human's special capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple neural model can imitate human in some tasks of art generation. We particularly focus on traditional Chinese poetry, and show that machines can do as well as many contemporary poets and weakly pass the Feigenbaum Test, a variant of Turing test in professional domains. Our method is based on an attention-based recurrent neural network, which accepts a set of keywords as the theme and generates poems by looking at each keyword during the generation. A number of techniques are proposed to improve the model, including character vector initialization, attention to input and hybrid-style training. Compared to existing poetry generation methods, our model can generate much more theme-consistent and semantic-rich poems. version:1

Unlike in a standard multi-class classification setting, misclassification costs depend on both recommended actions and customers. Our method transforms such a data set to a new set which can be used with standard interpretable multi-class classification algorithms. The transformation has the desirable property that minimizing the standard misclassification penalty in this new space is equivalent to minimizing the custom cost function. version:1

Despite its range of applications, eye tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology. We believe that we can put the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the need for additional sensors or devices. We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2.5M frames. Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device. Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively. With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm.

arxiv-1606-05804 | Generalizing to Unseen Entities and Entity Pairs with Row-less Universal Schema | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05804 | id:1606.05804 author:Patrick Verga, Arvind Neelakantan, Andrew McCallum category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-18 summary:Universal schema predicts the types of entities and relations in a knowledge base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types---not only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text. This prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one type per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity types or binary relation types, respectively). Factorizing this sparsely observed matrix yields a learned vector embedding for each row and each column. In this paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or entity-pairs unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row embedding). We propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of the observed columns for that row. We experiment with various aggregation functions, including neural network attention models. Our approach can be understood as a natural language database, in that questions about KB entities are answered by attending to textual or database evidence. In experiments predicting both relations and entity types, we demonstrate that despite having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than traditional universal schema, we can match the accuracy of the traditional model, and more importantly, we can now make predictions about unseen rows with nearly the same accuracy as rows available at training time. version:1

Malioutov category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-18 summary:As a contribution to interpretable machine learning research, we develop a novel optimization framework for learning accurate and sparse two-level Boolean rules. We consider rules in both conjunctive normal form (AND-of-ORs) and disjunctive normal form (OR-of-ANDs). A principled objective function is proposed to trade classification accuracy and interpretability, where we use Hamming loss to characterize accuracy and sparsity to characterize interpretability. We propose efficient procedures to optimize these objectives based on linear programming (LP) relaxation, block coordinate descent, and alternating minimization. Experiments show that our new algorithms provide very good tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability. version:1

A lot of data loss occurs in the projection. A domain based approach to reconstruction where we solve a smaller set of problems for a particular use case lead to greater returns. The project provides a way to automatically generate full 3-D renditions of actual symmetric images that have some prior information provided in the pipeline by a recognition algorithm. We provide a critical analysis on how this can be enhanced and improved to provide a general reconstruction framework for automatic reconstruction for any symmetric shape. version:1

Nevertheless, we believe that the long-and-well investigated domain-specific knowledge should still help to boost the performance of HCCR. By integrating the traditional normalization-cooperated direction-decomposed feature map (directMap) with the deep convolutional neural network (convNet), we are able to obtain new highest accuracies for both online and offline HCCR on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. With this new framework, we can eliminate the needs for data augmentation and model ensemble, which are widely used in other systems to achieve their best results. This makes our framework to be efficient and effective for both training and testing. Furthermore, although directMap+convNet can achieve the best results and surpass human-level performance, we show that writer adaptation in this case is still effective. A new adaptation layer is proposed to reduce the mismatch between training and test data on a particular source layer. The adaptation process can be efficiently and effectively implemented in an unsupervised manner. By adding the adaptation layer into the pre-trained convNet, it can adapt to the new handwriting styles of particular writers, and the recognition accuracy can be further improved consistently and significantly. This paper gives an overview and comparison of recent deep learning based approaches for HCCR, and also sets new benchmarks for both online and offline HCCR. version:1

Thus, our efforts focused on processing and standardizing Arabic, e.g., using tools such as 3arrib and MADAMIRA. We further trained a phrase-based SMT system using state-of-the-art features and components such as operation sequence model, class-based language model, sparse features, neural network joint model, genre-based hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration mining, phrase-table merging, and hypothesis combination.

But due to various factors and inappropriate primary education in India dropout rates are high. Students are unable to excel in core engineering subjects which are complex and mathematical, hence mostly get drop / keep term (kt) in that subject. With the help of data mining techniques we can predict the performance of students in terms of grades and dropout for a subject. This paper compares various techniques such as na\"ive Bayes, LibSVM, J48, random forest, and JRip and try to choose one of them as per our needs and their accuracy. Based on the rules obtained from this technique(s), we derive the key factors influencing student performance. version:1

This paper devises a Rotation and Relative Velocity (RRV) descriptor by exploring the local translational and rotational invariants of motion trajectories of rigid bodies, which is insensitive to noise, invariant to rigid transformation and scaling. A flexible metric is also introduced to measure the distance between two RRV descriptors. The RRV descriptor is then applied to characterize motions of a human body skeleton modeled as articulated interconnections of multiple rigid bodies. To illustrate the descriptive ability of the RRV descriptor, we explore it for different rigid body motion recognition tasks. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this simple RRV descriptor outperforms the previous ones regarding recognition accuracy without increasing computational cost. version:1
arxiv-1606-05725 | An Efficient Large-scale Semi-supervised Multi-label Classifier Capable of Handling Missing labels | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05725 | id:1606.05725 author:Amirhossein Akbarnejad, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah category:cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML  published:2016-06-18 summary:Multi-label classification has received considerable interest in recent years. Multi-label classifiers have to address many problems including: handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels, compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve prediction performance. To tackle datasets with a large set of labels, embedding-based methods have been proposed which seek to represent the label assignments in a low-dimensional space. Many state-of-the-art embedding-based methods use a linear dimensionality reduction to represent the label assignments in a low-dimensional space. However, by doing so, these methods actually neglect the tail labels - labels that are infrequently assigned to instances. We propose an embedding-based method that non-linearly embeds the label vectors using an stochastic approach, thereby predicting the tail labels more accurately. Moreover, the proposed method have excellent mechanisms for handling missing labels, dealing with large-scale datasets, as well as exploiting unlabeled data. With the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first multi-label classifier that simultaneously addresses all of the mentioned challenges. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms stateof-the-art multi-label classifiers by a large margin, in terms of prediction performance, as well as training time. version:1

Beck category:q-bio.QM cs.CV  published:2016-06-18 summary:The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) held a grand challenge to evaluate computational systems for the automated detection of metastatic breast cancer in whole slide images of sentinel lymph node biopsies. Our team won both competitions in the grand challenge, obtaining an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.925 for the task of whole slide image classification and a score of 0.7051 for the tumor localization task. A pathologist independently reviewed the same images, obtaining a whole slide image classification AUC of 0.966 and a tumor localization score of 0.733. Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's diagnoses increased the pathologist's AUC to 0.995, representing an approximately 85 percent reduction in human error rate. These results demonstrate the power of using deep learning to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pathological diagnoses. version:1

An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentence- or segment-level. We automatically construct a socially-tuned lexicon that is bootstrapped from existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons to further improve the performance. We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate online discussion corpora -- Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates. Our model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets. For example, the isotonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagreement detection, when a linear chain CRF obtains 0.58 and 0.56 for the discussions on Wikipedia Talk pages. version:1

Hauptmann, Chuang Gan, Xingzhong Du, Xiaojun Chang category:cs.IR cs.CV cs.MM  published:2016-06-17 summary:The large number of user-generated videos uploaded on to the Internet everyday has led to many commercial video search engines, which mainly rely on text metadata for search. However, metadata is often lacking for user-generated videos, thus these videos are unsearchable by current search engines. Therefore, content-based video retrieval (CBVR) tackles this metadata-scarcity problem by directly analyzing the visual and audio streams of each video. CBVR encompasses multiple research topics, including low-level feature design, feature fusion, semantic detector training and video search/reranking. We present novel strategies in these topics to enhance CBVR in both accuracy and speed under different query inputs, including pure textual queries and query by video examples. Our proposed strategies have been incorporated into our submission for the TRECVID 2014 Multimedia Event Detection evaluation, where our system outperformed other submissions in both text queries and video example queries, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. version:1

Pansharpening is a fusion technique used to increase the spatial resolution of the multispectral data while simultaneously preserving its spectral information. In this paper, we consider pansharpening as an optimization problem minimizing a cost function with a nonlocal regularization term. The energy functional which is to be minimized decouples for each band, thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral components. This requirement is achieved by dropping the, commonly used, assumption that relates the spectral and panchromatic modalities by a linear transformation. Instead, a new constraint that preserves the radiometric ratio between the panchromatic and each spectral component is introduced. An exhaustive performance comparison of the proposed fusion method with several classical and state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques illustrates its superiority in preserving spatial details, reducing color distortions, and avoiding the creation of aliasing artifacts. version:1

By experimenting on community QA and blog summarization, we show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation.

We instead aim to generate socially-informed timelines that contain both news article summaries and selected user comments. We present an optimization framework designed to balance topical cohesion between the article and comment summaries along with their informativeness and coverage of the event. Automatic evaluations on real-world datasets that cover four complex events show that our system produces more informative timelines than state-of-the-art systems. In human evaluation, the associated comment summaries are furthermore rated more insightful than editor's picks and comments ranked highly by users. version:1

Our final system is a combination of classifiers using word-level or character-level models.

The goal in such a problem is to minimize the (pseudo) regret which is the difference between the total expected loss of the algorithm and the total expected loss of the best fixed vector in hindsight. In this paper, we consider settings where the unknown parameter has structure, e.g., sparse, group sparse, low-rank, which can be captured by a norm, e.g., $L_1$, $L_{(1,2)}$, nuclear norm. We focus on constructing confidence ellipsoids which contain the unknown parameter across all rounds with high-probability. We show the radius of such ellipsoids depend on the Gaussian width of sets associated with the norm capturing the structure. Such characterization leads to tighter confidence ellipsoids and, therefore, sharper regret bounds compared to bounds in the existing literature which are based on the ambient dimensionality. version:1

Sebastian Seung category:cs.DC cs.LG  published:2016-06-17 summary:Sliding window convolutional networks (ConvNets) have become a popular approach to computer vision problems such as image segmentation, and object detection and localization. Here we consider the problem of inference, the application of a previously trained ConvNet, with emphasis on 3D images. Our goal is to maximize throughput, defined as average number of output voxels computed per unit time. Other things being equal, processing a larger image tends to increase throughput, because fractionally less computation is wasted on the borders of the image. It follows that an apparently slower algorithm may end up having higher throughput if it can process a larger image within the constraint of the available RAM. We introduce novel CPU and GPU primitives for convolutional and pooling layers, which are designed to minimize memory overhead. The primitives include convolution based on highly efficient pruned FFTs. Our theoretical analyses and empirical tests reveal a number of interesting findings. For some ConvNet architectures, cuDNN is outperformed by our FFT-based GPU primitives, and these in turn can be outperformed by our CPU primitives. The CPU manages to achieve higher throughput because of its fast access to more RAM. A novel primitive in which the GPU accesses host RAM can significantly increase GPU throughput. Finally, a CPU-GPU algorithm achieves the greatest throughput of all, 10x or more than other publicly available implementations of sliding window 3D ConvNets. All of our code has been made available as open source project. version:1

Olech, Halina Kwasnicka category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-17 summary:The field of Machine Learning and the topic of clustering within it is still widely researched. Recently, researchers became interested in a new variant of hierarchical clustering, where hierarchical (partial order) relationships exist not only between clusters but also objects. In this variant of clustering, objects can be assigned not only to leave, but other properties are also defined. Although examples of this approach already exist in literature, the authors have encountered a problem with the analysis and comparison of obtained results. The problem is twofold. Firstly, there is a lack of evaluation methods. Secondly, there is a lack of available benchmark data, at least the authors failed to find them. The aim of this work is to fill the second gap. The main contribution of this paper is a new method of generating hierarchical structures of data. Additionally, the paper includes a theoretical analysis of the generation parameters and their influence on the results. Comprehensive experiments are presented and discussed.

Of these, over 600 million were obese. Accurately documenting dietary caloric intake is crucial to manage weight loss, but also presents challenges because most of the current methods for dietary assessment must rely on memory to recall foods eaten. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop computer-aided technical solutions to enhance and improve the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake. Our proposed system in this paper aims to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images captured by mobile devices (e.g., smartphone). The key technique innovation in this paper is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms. Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other methods. However, how to derive the food information (e.g., food type and portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging and open research problem. We propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem. We applied our proposed approach to two real-world food image data sets (UEC-256 and Food-101) and achieved impressive results. To the best of our knowledge, these results outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future work includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and integrating our system into a real-world mobile and cloud computing-based system to enhance the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake. version:1

Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of brain decoding models. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, we present a simple definition for interpretability of linear brain decoding models. Then, we propose to combine the interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our preliminary results on the toy data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative linear models. The presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability in linear brain decoding. version:1

Carlson category:physics.soc-ph cs.NE cs.SI  published:2016-06-17 summary:Identifying factors that affect human decision making and quantifying their influence remain essential and challenging tasks for the design and implementation of social and technological communication systems. We report results of a behavioral experiment involving decision making in the face of an impending natural disaster. In a controlled laboratory setting, we characterize individual and group evacuation decision making influenced by several key factors, including the likelihood of the disaster, available shelter capacity, group size, and group decision protocol. Our results show that success in individual decision making is not a strong predictor of group performance. We use an artificial neural network trained on the collective behavior of subjects to predict individual and group outcomes. Overall model accuracy increases with the inclusion of a subject-specific performance parameter based on laboratory trials that captures individual differences. In parallel, we demonstrate that the social media activity of individual subjects, specifically their Facebook use, can be used to generate an alternative individual personality profile that leads to comparable model accuracy. Quantitative characterization and prediction of collective decision making is crucial for the development of effective policies to guide the action of populations in the face of threat or uncertainty. version:1

We propose a measure of surprise, to arrive at a new framework for surprise-driven learning. There are two components to this framework: (i) a confidence-adjusted surprise measure to capture environmental statistics as well as subjective beliefs, (ii) a surprise-minimization learning rule, or SMiLe-rule, which dynamically adjusts the balance between new and old information without making prior assumptions about the temporal statistics in the environment. We apply our framework to a dynamic decision making task and a maze exploration task to demonstrate that it is suitable for learning in complex environments, even if the environment undergoes gradual or sudden changes. Our proposed surprise-modulated belief update algorithm provides a framework to study the behavior of humans and animals encountering surprising events. version:1

Buhmann, Andreas Krause category:cs.LG cs.DS  published:2016-06-17 summary:\textit{Submodular continuous functions} are a category of (generally) non-convex/non-concave functions with a wide spectrum of applications. We characterize these functions and demonstrate that they can be maximized efficiently with approximation guarantees. Specifically, I) for monotone submodular continuous functions with an additional diminishing returns property, we propose a \texttt{Frank-Wolfe} style algorithm with $(1-1/e)$-approximation, and sub-linear convergence rate; II) for general non-monotone submodular continuous functions, we propose a \texttt{DoubleGreedy} algorithm with $1/3$-approximation. Submodular continuous functions naturally find applications in various real-world settings, including influence and revenue maximization with continuous assignments, sensor energy management, multi-resolution data summarization, facility location, etc. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently generate superior solutions in terms of empirical objectives compared to baseline algorithms. version:1

Nunes category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-17 summary:High resolution depth-maps, obtained by upsampling sparse range data from a 3D-LIDAR, find applications in many fields ranging from sensory perception to semantic segmentation and object detection. Upsampling is often based on combining data from a monocular camera to compensate the low-resolution of a LIDAR. This paper, on the other hand, introduces a novel framework to obtain dense depth-map solely from a single LIDAR point cloud; which is a research direction that has been barely explored. The formulation behind the proposed depth-mapping process relies on local spatial interpolation, using sliding-window (mask) technique, and on the Bilateral Filter (BF) where the variable of interest, the distance from the sensor, is considered in the interpolation problem. In particular, the BF is conveniently modified to perform depth-map upsampling such that the edges (foreground-background discontinuities) are better preserved by means of a proposed method which influences the range-based weighting term. Other methods for spatial upsampling are discussed, evaluated and compared in terms of different error measures. This paper also researches the role of the mask's size in the performance of the implemented methods. Quantitative and qualitative results from experiments on the KITTI Database, using LIDAR point clouds only, show very satisfactory performance of the approach introduced in this work. version:1

This type of bias is caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular Rand index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard Index (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of bias has been previously recognized in the literature. In this work, we identify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth (reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call this new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a change in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g., NCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to NCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth partition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased behaviour, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results. The objective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical implications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of such a property for external cluster validity indices. version:1

Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra category:stat.ML cs.CV  published:2016-06-17 summary:We conduct large-scale studies on `human attention' in Visual Question Answering (VQA) to understand where humans choose to look to answer questions about images. We design and test multiple game-inspired novel attention-annotation interfaces that require the subject to sharpen regions of a blurred image to answer a question. Thus, we introduce the VQA-HAT (Human ATtention) dataset. We evaluate attention maps generated by state-of-the-art VQA models against human attention both qualitatively (via visualizations) and quantitatively (via rank-order correlation). Overall, our experiments show that current attention models in VQA do not seem to be looking at the same regions as humans. version:1

Addressing this problem, we propose an unsupervised approach for learning disentangled representations of the underlying factors of variation. We draw inspiration from neuroscience, and show how this can be achieved in an unsupervised generative model by applying the same learning pressures as have been suggested to act in the ventral visual stream in the brain. By enforcing redundancy reduction, encouraging statistical independence, and exposure to data with transform continuities analogous to those to which human infants are exposed, we obtain a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework capable of learning disentangled factors. Our approach makes few assumptions and works well across a wide variety of datasets. Furthermore, our solution has useful emergent properties, such as zero-shot inference and an intuitive understanding of "objectness". version:1

Garnett, Ranjitha Kumar category:stat.ML cs.LG  published:2016-06-17 summary:Throughout music history, theorists have identified and documented interpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks, "Can a machine behave like a music theorist?" It presents MUS-ROVER, a self-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music. MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via $n$-gram models to extract compositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. We evaluate MUS-ROVER on Bach's (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recover known rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for further study. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and human composition. version:1

Stephen McGough category:cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE  published:2016-06-17 summary:In This paper we present a novel approach to spam filtering and demonstrate its applicability with respect to SMS messages. Our approach requires minimum features engineering and a small set of la- belled data samples. Features are extracted using topic modelling based on latent Dirichlet allocation, and then a comprehensive data model is created using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). Topic modelling summarises the data providing ease of use and high interpretability by visualising the topics using word clouds. Given that the SMS messages can be regarded as either spam (unwanted) or ham (wanted), the SDA is able to model the messages and accurately discriminate between the two classes without the need for a pre-labelled training set. The results are compared against the state-of-the-art spam detection algorithms with our proposed approach achieving over 97% accuracy which compares favourably to the best reported algorithms presented in the literature. version:1

Automated schemes for parameter tuning have been developed to alleviate the high costs of manual parameter tuning. Experimental results indicate that self-adaptation, where parameter settings are encoded in the genomes of individuals, can be effective in continuous optimisation. However, results in discrete optimisation have been less conclusive. Furthermore, a rigorous runtime analysis that explains how self-adaptation can lead to asymptotic speedups has been missing. This paper provides the first such analysis for discrete, population-based EAs. We apply level-based analysis to show how a self-adaptive EA is capable of fine-tuning its mutation rate, leading to exponential speedups over EAs using fixed mutation rates. version:1

Alonso category:cs.CL  published:2016-06-17 summary:We present a novel unsupervised approach for multilingual sentiment analysis driven by compositional syntax-based rules. On the one hand, we exploit some of the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are differently structured depending on the language. Experiments show an improvement both over existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when evaluating outside their corpus of origin. The system is freely available. version:1

One of the most popular tensor network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential multilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding the optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor decomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular multilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different algorithms. version:1

Over the last years convolutional neural networks have achieved almost human performance in recognizing concrete classes (i.e.\ specific object categories). This paper tests the performance of a current CNN (GoogLeNet) on the task of differentiating between abstract classes which are trivially differentiable for humans. We trained and tested the CNN on the two abstract classes of horizontal and vertical orientation and determined how well the network is able to transfer the learned classes to other, previously unseen objects. version:1

The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction techniques. Clustering part includes selection of cluster size and then labeling of time series data with reference to various clusters. Whereas, the prediction part include functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement PSF algorithm. It also contains a function, which automates all other functions to obtain optimum prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describe all the functions in PSF package with their syntax and simple examples. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it with auto.arima, a well known time series forecasting function available on CRAN repository. version:1

We were able to train both setups successfully using very little training data. The joint setup offers better performance, surpassing state-of-the-art with regards to n-gram-based scores while providing more relevant outputs. version:1

The required computational effort of CNNs today requires power-hungry parallel processors and GP-GPUs. Recent efforts in designing CNN Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and accelerators for System-On-Chip (SoC) integration have achieved very promising results. Unfortunately, even these highly optimized engines are still above the power envelope imposed by mobile and deeply embedded applications and face hard limitations caused by CNN weight I/O and storage. On the algorithmic side, highly competitive classification accuracy can be achieved by properly training CNNs with binary weights. This novel algorithm approach brings major optimization opportunities in the arithmetic core by removing the need for the expensive multiplications as well as in the weight storage and I/O costs. In this work, we present a HW accelerator optimized for BinaryConnect CNNs that achieves 1510 GOp/s on a core area of only 1.33 MGE and with a power dissipation of 153 mW in UMC 65 nm technology at 1.2 V. Our accelerator outperforms state-of-the-art performance in terms of ASIC energy efficiency as well as area efficiency with 61.2 TOp/s/W and 1135 GOp/s/MGE, respectively. version:1

Although names are strong gender indicators, the names of Twitter users are rarely used as a feature; probably due to the high number of ill-formed names, which cannot be found in any name dictionary. Instead of relying solely on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier. Our approach extracts characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names to a gender. This enables us to classify international first names as well as ill-formed names. version:1

Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned in the text or that training data for every target is given. This paper considers the more challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned and no training data is available for the test targets. We experiment with conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms the independent encoding of tweet and target. Performance improves even further when the conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. The method is evaluated on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus and achieves performance second best only to a system trained on semi-automatically labelled tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results. version:1

Current datasets, and the models built upon them, have focused on questions which are answerable by direct analysis of the question and image alone. The set of such questions that require no external information to answer is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce FVQA, a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA only contains questions which require external information to answer. We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which contains image-question-answerg triplets, through additional image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is represented as a structural triplet, such as <Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees>. We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel model which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of supporting facts. version:1

However, these networks are computationally demanding and not suitable for embedded devices where memory and time consumption are relevant. In this paper, we propose DecomposeMe, a simple but effective technique to learn features using 1D convolutions. The proposed architecture enables both simplicity and filter sharing leading to increased learning capacity. A comprehensive set of large-scale experiments on ImageNet and Places2 demonstrates the ability of our method to improve performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters required. Notably, on Places2, we obtain an improvement in relative top-1 classification accuracy of 7.7\% with an architecture that requires 92% fewer parameters compared to VGG-B. The proposed network is also demonstrated to generalize to other tasks by converting existing networks. version:1

Similar to the region-based CNNs, our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the region-of-interest (RoI) detection component. However, far apart of that network, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection. Firstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI detection to deal with tiny face regions. Secondly, our proposed network allows explicit body contextual reasoning in the network inspired from the intuition of human vision system. The proposed approach is benchmarked on two recent challenging face detection databases, i.e. the WIDER FACE Dataset which contains high degree of variability, as well as the Face Detection Dataset and Benchmark (FDDB). The experimental results show that our proposed approach trained on WIDER FACE Dataset outperforms strong baselines on WIDER FACE Dataset by a large margin, and consistently achieves competitive results on FDDB against the recent state-of-the-art face detection methods. version:1

Amancio, Francisco A. Rodrigues, Luciano da F. Costa category:physics.soc-ph physics.data-an stat.ML  published:2016-06-17 summary:The increasing interest in complex networks research has been a consequence of several intrinsic features of this area, such as the generality of the approach to represent and model virtually any discrete system, and the incorporation of concepts and methods deriving from many areas, from statistical physics to sociology, which are often used in an independent way. Yet, for this same reason, it would be desirable to integrate these various aspects into a more coherent and organic framework, which would imply in several benefits normally allowed by the systematization in science, including the identification of new types of problems and the cross-fertilization between fields. More specifically, the identification of the main areas to which the concepts frequently used in complex networks can be applied paves the way to adopting and applying a larger set of concepts and methods deriving from those respective areas. Among the several areas that have been used in complex networks research, pattern recognition, optimization, linear algebra, and time series analysis seem to play a more basic and recurrent role. In the present manuscript, we propose a systematic way to integrate the concepts from these diverse areas regarding complex networks research. In order to do so, we start by grouping the multidisciplinary concepts into three main groups, namely features, similarity, and network connectivity. Then we show that several of the analysis and modeling approaches to complex networks can be thought as a composition of maps between these three groups, with emphasis on nine main types of mappings, which are presented and illustrated. Such a systematization of principles and approaches also provides an opportunity to review some of the most closely related works in the literature, which is also developed in this article. version:1

In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably as interpretable. version:1

Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that addresses these challenges. version:1
arxiv-1606-05381 | Deep Image Set Hashing | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05381 | id:1606.05381 author:Jie Feng, Svebor Karaman, Shih-Fu Chang category:cs.CV  published:2016-06-16 summary:In applications involving matching of image sets, the information from multiple images must be effectively exploited to represent each set. State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a set and use specific distance measure to compare two sets. These methods are slow to compute and not compact to use in a large scale scenario. Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be used to efficiently compare two samples. However, most hashing methods encode each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same set represent the same object or person. We investigate the set hashing problem by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image features, then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming set similarity relations using class labels. We extensively evaluate our approach on datasets used for image matching and show highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. version:1

With only denotations at training time, we must search over a combinatorially large space of logical forms, which is even larger with context-dependent utterances. To cope with this challenge, we perform successive projections of the full model onto simpler models that operate over equivalence classes of logical forms. Though less expressive, we find that these simpler models are much faster and can be surprisingly effective. Moreover, they can be used to bootstrap the full model. Finally, we collected three new context-dependent semantic parsing datasets, and develop a new left-to-right parser. version:1

An unknown set of $\alpha n$ workers generate reliable ratings, while the remaining workers may behave arbitrarily and possibly adversarially. The manager of the experiment can also manually evaluate the quality of a small number of items, and wishes to curate together almost all of the high-quality items with at most an $\epsilon$ fraction of low-quality items. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this is possible with an amount of work required of the manager, and each worker, that does not scale with $n$: the dataset can be curated with $\tilde{O}\Big(\frac{1}{\beta\alpha^3\epsilon^4}\Big)$ ratings per worker, and $\tilde{O}\Big(\frac{1}{\beta\epsilon^2}\Big)$ ratings by the manager, where $\beta$ is the fraction of high-quality items. Our results extend to the more general setting of peer prediction, including peer grading in online classrooms. version:1

There are several challenges: though the dataset is typically large-scale, demand per time period and locality is almost always zero. The demand arises from complex urban geography and exhibits complex spatio-temporal patterns, both of which need to captured and exploited. To address these challenges, we propose three methods based on Gaussian mixture models, kernel density estimation, and kernel warping. These methods provide spatio-temporal predictions for Toronto and Melbourne that are significantly more accurate than the current industry practice. version:1

In our approach, we compute kinematic features from optical flow and first and second-order derivatives of intensities to represent motion and appearance respectively. These features are then used to construct covariance matrices which capture joint statistics of both low-level motion and appearance features extracted from a video. Using an over-complete dictionary of the covariance based descriptors built from labeled training samples, we formulate low-level event recognition as a sparse linear approximation problem. Within this, we pose the sparse decomposition of a covariance matrix, which also conforms to the space of semi-positive definite matrices, as a determinant maximization problem. Also since covariance matrices lie on non-linear Riemannian manifolds, we compare our former approach with a sparse linear approximation alternative that is suitable for equivalent vector spaces of covariance matrices. This is done by searching for the best projection of the query data on a dictionary using an Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm. We show the applicability of our video descriptor in two different application domains - namely low-level event recognition in unconstrained scenarios and gesture recognition using one shot learning. Our experiments provide promising insights in large scale video analysis. version:1

The form of the estimator is similar to the Hutchison stochastic trace estimator, but instead of the random noise vectors in Hutchison estimator, we use small number of probing vectors determined by machine learning. Evaluation of the quality of estimates and bias correction are discussed. An unbiased estimator is proposed for the calculation of the expectation value of a function of traces. In the numerical experiments with random matrices, it is shown that the precision of trace estimates with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ probing vectors determined by the machine learning is similar to that with $\mathcal{O}(10000)$ random noise vectors. version:1

Varshney, Mahmoud Naghshineh category:cs.CY stat.ML  published:2016-06-15 summary:Innovation is among the key factors driving a country's economic and social growth. But what are the factors that make a country innovative? How do they differ across different parts of the world and different stages of development? In this work done in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), we analyze the scores obtained through executive opinion surveys that constitute the WEF's Global Competitiveness Index in conjunction with other country-level metrics and indicators to identify actionable levers of innovation. The findings can help country leaders and organizations shape the policies to drive developmental activities and increase the capacity of innovation. version:1
