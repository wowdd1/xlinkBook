baidu-research-03 | CFO: Conditional Focused Neural Question Answering with Large-scale Knowledge Bases. | http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01994 | author:Zihang Dai, Lei Li and Wei Xu summary:How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like “Who created the character Harry Potter”? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions — ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7% on a dataset of 108k questions – the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8%. description:Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2016) 
baidu-research-04 | Deep Recurrent Models with Fast-Forward Connections for Neural Machine Translation. | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=baidu-research-04 Deep Recurrent Models with Fast-Forward Connections for Neural Machine Translation. | author:Jie Zhou, Ying Cao, Xuguang Wang, Peng Li, Wei Xu summary:Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation (MT) problems with purely neural networks and exhibits promising results in recent years. However, most of the existing NMT models are of shallow topology and there is still a performance gap between the single NMT model and the best conventional MT system. In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, named fast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, together with the interleaved bi-directional way for stacking them. Fast-forward connections play an essential role to propagate the gradients in building the deep topology of depth 16. On WMTâ14 English- to-French task, we achieved BLEU=37.7 with single attention model, which outperforms the corresponding single shallow model by 6.2 BLEU points. It is the first time that a single NMT model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the best conventional model by 0.7 BLEU points. Even without considering attention mechanism, we can still achieve BLEU=36.3. After the special handling for unknown words and the model ensembling, we obtained the best score on this task with BLEU=40.4. Our models are also verified on the more difficult WMTâ14 English-to-German task. description:Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2016) 
baidu-research-05 | Online Reconstruction of Indoor Scenes from RGB-D Streams | https://www.dropbox.com/s/c2lphbhuynmd03a/OnlineReconstructionofIndoorScenesfromRGBDStreams.pdf?dl=0 | author:Wang Hao, Wang Jun, Wang Liang summary:A system capable of performing robust online volumetric reconstruction of indoor scenes based on input from a handheld RGB-D camera is presented. Our system is powered by a two-pass reconstruction scheme. The first pass tracks camera poses at video rate and simultaneously constructs a pose graph on-the-fly. The tracker operates in real-time, which allows the reconstruction results to be visualized during the scanning process. Live visual feedbacks make the scanning operation fast and intuitive. Upon termination of scanning, the second pass takes place to handle loop closures and reconstruct the final model using globally refined camera trajectories. The system is online with low delay and returns a dense model of sufficient accuracy. The beauty of this system lies in its speed, accuracy, simplicity and ease of implementation when compared to previous methods. We demonstrate the performance of our system on several real-world scenes and quantitatively assess the modeling accuracy with respect to ground truth models obtained from a LIDAR scanner. description:Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2016), dataset 
baidu-research-06 | CNN-RNN: A Unified Framework for Multi-label Image Classification | http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04573 | author:Jiang Wang, Yi Yang, Junhua Mao, Zhiheng Huang, Chang Huang, and Wei Xu summary:While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in single-label image classification, it is important to note that real world images generally contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image. Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem. Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label classification model. description:Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition- Oral (2016) 
baidu-research-07 | Video Paragraph Captioning using Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07712v2.pdf | author:Haonan Yu, Jiang Wang, Yi Yang, Zhiheng Huang, Wei Xu summary:We present an approach that exploits hierarchical Recur- rent Neural Networks (RNNs) to tackle the video captioning problem, i.e., generating one or multiple sentences to de- scribe a realistic video. Our hierarchical framework con- tains a sentence generator and a paragraph generator. The sentence generator produces one simple short sentence that describes a specific short video interval. It exploits both temporal- and spatial-attention mechanisms to selectively focus on visual elements during generation. The paragraph generator captures the inter-sentence dependency by taking as input the sentential embedding produced by the sentence generator, combining it with the paragraph history, and outputting the new initial state for the sentence generator. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale benchmark datasets: YouTubeClips and TACoS-MultiLevel. The exper- iments demonstrate that our approach significantly outper- forms the current state-of-the-art methods with BLEU@4 scores 0.499 and 0.305 respectively. description:Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition- Oral (2016)
