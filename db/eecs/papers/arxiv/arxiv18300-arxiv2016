arxiv-18300-1 | Linear-memory and Decomposition-invariant Linearly Convergent Conditional Gradient Algorithm for Structured Polytopes | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06492v1.pdf | author:Dan Garber, Ofer Meshi category:math.OC cs.LG published:2016-05-20 summary:Recently, several works have shown that natural modifications of theclassical conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) forconstrained convex optimization, provably converge with a linear rate when: i)the feasible set is a polytope, and ii) the objective is smooth andstrongly-convex. However, all of these results suffer from two significantshortcomings: large memory requirement due to the need to store an explicitconvex decomposition of the current iterate, and as a consequence, largerunning-time overhead per iteration, and worst case convergence rate thatdepends unfavorably on the dimension. In this work we present a new conditional gradient variant and acorresponding analysis that improves on both of the above shortcomings. Inparticular: both memory and computation overheads are only linear in thedimension. Moreover, in case the optimal solution is sparse, the newconvergence rate replaces a factor which is at least linear in the dimension inprevious works, with a linear dependence on the number of non-zeros in theoptimal solution. At the heart of our method, and corresponding analysis, is a novel way tocompute decomposition-invariant away-steps. While our theoretical guarantees donot apply to any polytope, they apply to several important structured polytopesthat capture central concepts such as paths in graphs, perfect matchings inbipartite graphs, marginal distributions that arise in structured predictiontasks, and more. Our theoretical findings are complemented by empiricalevidence which shows that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance.

Our sparse connection structure facilitates asignificant reduction in computational cost and number of parameters ofstate-of-the-art deep CNNs without compromising accuracy. We validate ourapproach by using it to train more efficient variants of state-of-the-art CNNarchitectures, evaluated on the CIFAR10 and ILSVRC datasets. Our results showsimilar or higher accuracy than the baseline architectures with much lesscompute, as measured by CPU and GPU timings. For example, for ResNet 50, ourmodel has 40% fewer parameters, 45% fewer floating point operations, and is 31%(12%) faster on a CPU (GPU). For the deeper ResNet 200 our model has 25% fewerfloating point operations and 44% fewer parameters, while maintainingstate-of-the-art accuracy. For GoogLeNet, our model has 7% fewer parameters andis 21% (16%) faster on a CPU (GPU).

Furthermore, we assume all prior knowledge that can beautomatically extracted from databases has already been taken into account.This setup occurs in personalized medicine, for instance, when predictingtreatment outcomes for an individual patient based on noisy high-dimensionalgenomics data. A remaining source of information is expert knowledge which hasreceived relatively little attention in recent years. We formulate theinference problem of asking expert feedback on features on a budget, presentexperimental results for two setups: "small $n$" and "n=1 with similar dataavailable", and derive conditions under which the elicitation strategy isoptimal. Experiments on simulated experts, both on simulated and genomics data,demonstrate that the proposed strategy can drastically improve predictionaccuracy.

Rodrigues, Ingrid Daubechies category:cs.CV published:2016-05-20 summary:In support of art investigation, we propose a new source sepa- ration methodthat unmixes a single X-ray scan acquired from double-sided paintings. Unlikeprior source separation meth- ods, which are based on statistical or structuralincoherence of the sources, we use visual images taken from the front- andback-side of the panel to drive the separation process. The coupling of the twoimaging modalities is achieved via a new multi-scale dictionary learningmethod. Experimental results demonstrate that our method succeeds in thediscrimination of the sources, while state-of-the-art methods fail to do so.

Swapout samples from a rich set of architectures includingdropout, stochastic depth and residual architectures as special cases. Whenviewed as a regularization method swapout not only inhibits co-adaptation ofunits in a layer, similar to dropout, but also across network layers. Weconjecture that swapout achieves strong regularization by implicitly tying theparameters across layers. When viewed as an ensemble training method, itsamples a much richer set of architectures than existing methods such asdropout or stochastic depth. We propose a parameterization that revealsconnections to exiting architectures and suggests a much richer set ofarchitectures to be explored. We show that our formulation suggests anefficient training method and validate our conclusions on CIFAR-10 andCIFAR-100 matching state of the art accuracy. Remarkably, our 32 layer widermodel performs similar to a 1001 layer ResNet model.

In this work, we instead leverage therecent progress in computer graphics to generate fully labeled, dynamic, andphoto-realistic proxy virtual worlds. We propose an efficient real-to-virtualworld cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publiclyreleasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (seehttp://www.xrce.xerox.com/Research-Development/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds),automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection,tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow. We providequantitative experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learningalgorithms pre-trained on real data behave similarly in real and virtualworlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual data improves performance. As the gapbetween real and virtual worlds is small, virtual worlds enable measuring theimpact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition performance,all other things being equal. We show these factors may affect drasticallyotherwise high-performing deep models for tracking.

Whether BP converges and if thesolution is a unique fixed point depends on both, the structure and theparametrization of the model. To understand this dependence we are interestedin finding \emph{all} fixed points. In this work, we formulate BP as a set ofpolynomial equations, the solutions of which correspond to the BP fixed points.We apply the numerical polynomial-homotopy-continuation (NPHC) method to solvesuch systems. It is commonly believed that uniqueness of BP fixed pointsimplies convergence to this fixed point. Contrary to this conjecture, we findgraphs for which BP fails to converge, even though a unique fixed point exists.Moreover, we show that this fixed point gives a good approximation of the exactmarginal distribution.
arxiv-18300-9 | Query-Efficient Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06450v1.pdf | author:Jiakai Zhang, Kyunghyun Cho category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO published:2016-05-20 summary:One way to approach end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a policyfunction that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from afront-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or areference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policyfunction is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted andground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known tosuffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the statesreachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advancedalgorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue byiteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trainedpolicies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to areference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is oftenexpensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, calledSafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomousdriving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and showthat it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe asignificant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to theeffect of automated curriculum learning.
arxiv-18300-10 | ATD: Anomalous Topic Discovery in High Dimensional Discrete Data | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06452v2.pdf | author:Hossein Soleimani, David J. Miller category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2015-12-20 summary:We propose an algorithm for detecting patterns exhibited by anomalousclusters in high dimensional discrete data. Unlike most anomaly detection (AD)methods, which detect individual anomalies, our proposed method detects groups(clusters) of anomalies; i.e. sets of points which collectively exhibitabnormal patterns. In many applications this can lead to better understandingof the nature of the atypical behavior and to identifying the sources of theanomalies. Moreover, we consider the case where the atypical patterns exhibiton only a small (salient) subset of the very high dimensional feature space.Individual AD techniques and techniques that detect anomalies using all thefeatures typically fail to detect such anomalies, but our method can detectsuch instances collectively, discover the shared anomalous patterns exhibitedby them, and identify the subsets of salient features. In this paper, we focuson detecting anomalous topics in a batch of text documents, developing ouralgorithm based on topic models. Results of our experiments show that ourmethod can accurately detect anomalous topics and salient features (words)under each such topic in a synthetic data set and two real-world text corporaand achieves better performance compared to both standard group AD andindividual AD techniques. All required code to reproduce our experiments isavailable from https://github.com/hsoleimani/ATD

It is not well understood how learning occurs in these systems,in particular how they avoid getting trapped in configurations with poorcomputational performance. Here we study the difficult case of networks withdiscrete weights, where the optimization landscape is very rough even forsimple architectures, and provide theoretical and numerical evidence of theexistence of rare---but extremely dense and accessible---regions ofconfigurations in the network weight space. We define a novel measure, which wecall the \emph{robust ensemble} (RE), which suppresses trapping by isolatedconfigurations and amplifies the role of these dense regions. We analyticallycompute the RE in some exactly solvable models, and also provide a generalalgorithmic scheme which is straightforward to implement: define acost-function given by a sum of a finite number of replicas of the originalcost-function, with a constraint centering the replicas around a drivingassignment. To illustrate this, we derive several powerful new algorithms,ranging from Markov Chains to message passing to gradient descent processes,where the algorithms target the robust dense states, resulting in substantialimprovements in performance. The weak dependence on the number of precisionbits of the weights leads us to conjecture that very similar reasoning appliesto more conventional neural networks. Analogous algorithmic schemes can also beapplied to other optimization problems.

Byintroducing a new complexity measure that explicitly factors in the structureof the output space and the loss function, we are able to derive newdata-dependent learning guarantees for a broad family of losses and forhypothesis sets with an arbitrary factor graph decomposition. We extend thistheory by leveraging the principle of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM) and showingthat learning is possible with complex factor graphs. We both present newlearning bounds in this advanced setting as well as derive two new families ofalgorithms, \emph{Voted Conditional Random Fields} and \emph{Voted StructuredBoosting}, which can make use of very complex features and factor graphswithout overfitting. Finally, we also validate our theory through experimentson several datasets.

Koolen, Peter Grünwald, Tim van Erven category:cs.LG published:2016-05-20 summary:We consider online learning algorithms that guarantee worst-case regret ratesin adversarial environments (so they can be deployed safely and will performrobustly), yet adapt optimally to favorable stochastic environments (so theywill perform well in a variety of settings of practical importance). Wequantify the friendliness of stochastic environments by means of the well-knownBernstein (a.k.a. generalized Tsybakov margin) condition. For two recentalgorithms (Squint for the Hedge setting and MetaGrad for online convexoptimization) we show that the particular form of their data-dependentindividual-sequence regret guarantees implies that they adapt automatically tothe Bernstein parameters of the stochastic environment. We prove that thesealgorithms attain fast rates in their respective settings both in expectationand with high probability.

We reduce the complexity ofalgorithm design for machine learning by reductions: we develop reductions thattake a method developed for one setting and apply it to the entire spectrum ofsmoothness and strong-convexity in applications. Furthermore, unlike existing results, our new reductions are OPTIMAL and morePRACTICAL. We show how these new reductions give rise to new and faster runningtimes on training linear classifiers for various families of loss functions,and conclude with experiments showing their successes also in practice.

Bronstein category:cs.CV published:2016-05-20 summary:Establishing correspondence between shapes is a fundamental problem ingeometry processing, arising in a wide variety of applications. The problem isespecially difficult in the setting of non-isometric deformations, as well asin the presence of topological noise and missing parts, mainly due to thelimited capability to model such deformations axiomatically. Several recentworks showed that invariance to complex shape transformations can be learnedfrom examples. In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic convolutional neuralnetwork architecture based on anisotropic diffusion kernels, which we termAnisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN). In our construction, wegeneralize convolutions to non-Euclidean domains by constructing a set oforiented anisotropic diffusion kernels, creating in this way a local intrinsicpolar representation of the data (`patch'), which is then correlated with afilter. Several cascades of such filters, linear, and non-linear operators arestacked to form a deep neural network whose parameters are learned byminimizing a task-specific cost. We use ACNNs to effectively learn intrinsicdense correspondences between deformable shapes in very challenging settings,achieving state-of-the-art results on some of the most difficult recentcorrespondence benchmarks.

Leveraging recentadvances in Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, DVBF can overcomeintractable inference distributions by means of variational inference. Thus, itcan handle highly nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial dependenciessuch as image sequences without domain knowledge. Our experiments show thatenabling backpropagation through transitions enforces state space assumptionsand significantly improves information content of the latent embedding. Thisalso enables realistic long-term prediction.

This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wideanomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on aspatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolicdynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among thesubsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used tolearn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Theresults show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions isdifferent from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomalydetection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with onegraphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integratedbuilding system validate the proposed approach.

This observation is supported by alarge-scale lesion study that demonstrates they behave just like ensembles attest time. Subsequently, we perform an analysis showing these ensembles mostlyconsist of networks that are each relatively shallow. For example, contrary toour expectations, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layerscomes from an ensemble of very short networks, i.e., only 10-34 layers deep.This suggests that in addition to describing neural networks in terms of widthand depth, there is a third dimension: multiplicity, the size of the implicitensemble. Ultimately, residual networks do not resolve the vanishing gradientproblem by preserving gradient flow throughout the entire depth of the network- rather, they avoid the problem simply by ensembling many short networkstogether. This insight reveals that depth is still an open research questionand invites the exploration of the related notion of multiplicity.

Huggins, Trevor Campbell, Tamara Broderick category:stat.CO cs.DS stat.ML published:2016-05-20 summary:The use of Bayesian models in large-scale data settings is attractive becauseof the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and priorspecification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms arecomputationally expensive, however, making their direct application to largedatasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference hasfocused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only arandom data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data isoften redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called acoreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use thissmall coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms withoutmodification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset constructionalgorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoreticalguarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both forfixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generativemodels. The proposed approach also permits efficient construction of thecoreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additionaleffort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of syntheticand real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset isindependent of the original dataset size.

We introducean efficient local algorithm based on a power iteration of the non-backtrackingoperator and study its performance on a simple model. For the case of twoclusters, we give bounds on the classification error and show that a smallerror can be achieved from $O(n)$ randomly chosen measurements, where $n$ isthe number of items in the dataset. Our algorithm is therefore efficient bothin terms of time and space complexities. We also investigate numerically theperformance of the algorithm on synthetic and real world data.

In thisregard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex faultpropagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paperpresents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressingsuch issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extractionscheme for multivariate time series built on the concept of symbolic dynamicsfor discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of acomplex system. We propose sequential state switching ($S^3$) and artificialanomaly association ($A^3$) methods to implement root-cause analysis in anunsupervised and semi-supervised manner respectively. Synthetic data from caseswith failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are simulated to validate theproposed approaches, then compared with the performance of vectorautoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis. The results show that:(1) $S^3$ and $A^3$ approaches can obtain high accuracy in root-cause analysisand successfully handle multiple nominal operation modes, and (2) the proposedtool-chain is shown to be scalable while maintaining high accuracy.

Huggins, James Zou category:math.ST math.PR stat.CO stat.ML stat.TH published:2016-05-20 summary:Diffusions and their discretizations as Markov chains are a workhorse forinference, sampling and modeling. With the growth of large-scale datasets, thecomputational cost associated with simulating these stochastic processes can beconsiderable, and many algorithms have been proposed to approximate theunderlying Markov chain or diffusion. A fundamental question is how thecomputational savings trade off against the statistical error incurred due toapproximations. This paper develops general results to investigate thisquestion. We bound the Wasserstein distance between the equilibriumdistributions of two diffusions as a function of their mixing rates and thedeviation in their drifts. We show that this error bound is exact in simpleGaussian settings. This general result on continuous diffusions can bediscretized to provide insights on the computational--statistical trade-off ofMarkov chains. As an illustration, we apply our framework to derivefinite-sample error bounds of approximate unadjusted Langevin dynamics. Wecharacterize computation-constrained settings where, by using fast-to-computeapproximate gradients in the Langevin dynamics, we obtain more accurate samplescompared to using the exact gradients. Our theoretical analyses are supportedby simulation experiments.

However combining them in a principal way is nontrivial, as theyare generally abstracted by different structures (closed string vs graph),respectively. This paper aims at addressing the shape recognition problem bycombining contour and skeleton according to the correspondence between them.The correspondence provides a straightforward way to associate skeletalinformation with a shape contour. More specifically, we propose a new shapedescriptor. named Skeleton-associated Shape Context (SSC), which captures thefeatures of a contour fragment associated with skeletal information. Benefitedfrom the association, the proposed shape descriptor provides the complementarygeometric information from both contour and skeleton parts, including thespatial distribution and the thickness change along the shape part. To form ameaningful shape feature vector for an overall shape, the Bag of Featuresframework is applied to the SSC descriptors extracted from it. Finally, theshape feature vector is fed into a linear SVM classifier to recognize theshape. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wayto combine contour and skeleton is effective for shape recognition, whichachieves the state-of-the-art performances on several standard shapebenchmarks.

It is estimatedusing the empirical tree, which is the cluster tree constructed from a densityestimator. This paper addresses the basic question of quantifying ouruncertainty by assessing the statistical significance of features of anempirical cluster tree. We first study a variety of metrics that can be used tocompare different trees, analyze their properties and assess their suitabilityfor inference. We then propose methods to construct and summarize confidencesets for the unknown true cluster tree. We introduce a partial ordering oncluster trees which we use to prune some of the statistically insignificantfeatures of the empirical tree, yielding interpretable and parsimonious clustertrees. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods on a variety of syntheticexamples and furthermore demonstrate their utility in the analysis of aGraft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) data set.

In contrast to previous region-based detectors suchas Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds oftimes, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost allcomputation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we proposeposition-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma betweentranslation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance inobject detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional imageclassifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), forobject detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g.,83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile, our result isachieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image, 2.5-20x faster than theFaster R-CNN counterpart. Code will be made publicly available.

Their performance in computer vision have matched and in someareas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capturecomplex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of highcomputational and memory requirements. State-of-art networks require billionsof arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devicessuch as smartphones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishingpower of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decreaseboth execution time and power consumption. In applications where fastconnection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important,computation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deepneural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step ofaccelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, whichenables energy-efficient inference. We present Ristretto, a fast and automatedframework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic ofa custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of networkparameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip areafor multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove theneed for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. Thetool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Sincetraining of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highlyoptimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of anygiven network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfullycondense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.

While the algorithmic extension is straightforward,it comes with challenges and opportunities: (a) the convex minimizationanalysis does not apply and we use the notion of monotone operators to proveconvergence, showing in particular that the same algorithm applies to a largerclass of problems, such as variational inequalities, (b) there are two notionsof splits, in terms of functions, or in terms of partial derivatives, (c) thesplit does need to be done with convex-concave terms, (d) non-uniform samplingis key to an efficient algorithm, both in theory and practice, and (e) theseincremental algorithms can be easily accelerated using a simple extension ofthe "catalyst" framework, leading to an algorithm which is always superior toaccelerated batch algorithms.

Thissetting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, wepresent a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learnscross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach isbased on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly orimplicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, torealise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks.This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need auser-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to bothhomogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ourdeep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy andfewer design choices.

Ovaska category:cs.LG cs.AI published:2016-05-20 summary:After data selection, pre-processing, transformation, and feature extraction,knowledge extraction is not the final step in a data mining process. It is thennecessary to understand this knowledge in order to apply it efficiently andeffectively. Up to now, there is a lack of appropriate techniques that supportthis significant step. This is partly due to the fact that the assessment ofknowledge is often highly subjective, e.g., regarding aspects such as noveltyor usefulness. These aspects depend on the specific knowledge and requirementsof the data miner. There are, however, a number of aspects that are objectiveand for which it is possible to provide appropriate measures. In this articlewe focus on classification problems and use probabilistic generativeclassifiers based on mixture density models that are quite common in datamining applications. We define objective measures to assess theinformativeness, uniqueness, importance, discrimination, representativity,uncertainty, and distinguishability of rules contained in these classifiersnumerically. These measures not only support a data miner in evaluating resultsof a data mining process based on such classifiers. As we will see inillustrative case studies, they may also be used to improve the data miningprocess itself or to support the later application of the extracted knowledge.

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are used to inferproperties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximatethe posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an$\epsilon$-ball around the observed data, which is only correct in the limit$\epsilon\!\rightarrow\!0$. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from theapproximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters.These algorithms critically slow down as $\epsilon\!\rightarrow\!0$, and inpractice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. Wepropose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesianconditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limitedsimulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases, learning anaccurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distributionrequires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo ABC methods need to produce asingle sample from an approximate posterior.

Currently, developing task-oriented dialogue systems requirescreating multiple components and typically this involves either a large amountof handcrafting, or acquiring labelled datasets and solving a statisticallearning problem for each component. In this work we introduce a neuralnetwork-based text-in, text-out end-to-end trainable dialogue system along witha new way of collecting task-oriented dialogue data based on a novel pipe-linedWizard-of-Oz framework. This approach allows us to develop dialogue systemseasily and without making too many assumptions about the task at hand. Theresults show that the model can converse with human subjects naturally whilsthelping them to accomplish tasks in a restaurant search domain.

arxiv-18300-35 | Learning to Discover Probabilistic Graphical Model Structures | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06359v1.pdf | author:Eugene Belilovsky, Kyle Kastner, Gaël Varoquaux, Matthew Blaschko category:stat.ML published:2016-05-20 summary:In this work we consider structure discovery of undirected graphical modelsfrom observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is acomplex task often requiring formulating priors and sophisticated inferenceprocedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popularapproach to formulating an estimator is with a penalized maximum likelihoodobjective on the precision matrix. This objective is often difficult to designto specifically fit ones priors and the graph structure recovery is often notexplicitly possible to embed in the objective, moreover incorporating anyadditional assumptions often requires a great deal of research effort. Bycontrast, it may be easier to generate samples of data that are arise fromgraphs with the desired properties. We propose here to leverage this lattersource of information in order to learn a function that maps from empiricalcovariance matrices to estimated graph structures. This learned function bringstwo benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity propertiesto form suitable priors, and it can more directly be tailored to the specificproblem of edge structure discovery. We apply this framework to severalcritical real world problems in structure discovery and show that it can becompetitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction ofthe execution speed. We use deep neural networks to parametrize our estimators.Experimentally, our learn able graph discovery method trained on synthetic datageneralizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data,completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging,and simulation data we obtain competitive (and often superior) performance,compared with analytical methods.

Afterimplementing M$^2$ as a scorer in the Moses tuning framework, we investigateinteractions of dense and sparse features, different optimizers, and tuningstrategies for the CoNLL-2014 shared task. We notice erratic behavior whenoptimizing sparse feature weights with M$^2$ and offer partial solutions. Toour surprise, we find that a bare-bones phrase-based SMT setup withtask-specific parameter-tuning outperforms all previously published results forthe CoNLL-2014 test set by a large margin (46.37% M$^2$ over previously 40.56%,by a neural encoder-decoder model) while being trained on the same data. Ournewly introduced dense and sparse features widen that gap, and we improve thestate-of-the-art to 49.49% M$^2$.

More specifically, we consider afunction defined by local sparse models, one at each data point. We introducesample-wise network regularization to borrow strength across the models, andsample-wise exclusive group sparsity (a.k.a., $\ell_{1,2}^2$ norm) to introducediversity into the choice of feature sets in the local models. The local modelsare interpretable in terms of similarity of their sparsity patterns. The costfunction is convex, and thus has a globally optimal solution. Moreover, wepropose a simple yet efficient iterative least-squares based optimizationprocedure for the localized Lasso, which does not need a tuning parameter, andis guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal solution. The solution isempirically shown to outperform alternatives for both simulated and genomicpersonalized medicine data.

The algorithm isbased on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected adjacency matrixin a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel withoverlap (SBMO).An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not require the knowledge ofthe number of hidden communities, is proved to be consistent under the SBMOwhen the degrees in the graph are (slightly more than) logarithmic. Thealgorithm is shown to perform well on simulateddata and on real-world graphswith known overlapping communities.
arxiv-18300-39 | Unsupervised Feature Extraction by Time-Contrastive Learning and Nonlinear ICA | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06336v1.pdf | author:Aapo Hyvarinen, Hiroshi Morioka category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2016-05-20 summary:Nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) provides an appealingframework for unsupervised feature learning, but the models proposed so far arenot identifiable. Here, we first propose a new intuitive principle ofunsupervised deep learning from time series which uses the nonstationarystructure of the data. Our learning principle, time-contrastive learning (TCL),finds a representation which allows optimal discrimination of time segments(windows). Surprisingly, we show how TCL can be related to a nonlinear ICAmodel, when ICA is redefined to include temporal nonstationarities. Inparticular, we show that TCL combined with linear ICA estimates the nonlinearICA model up to point-wise transformations of the sources, and this solution isunique --- thus providing the first identifiability result for nonlinear ICAwhich is rigorous, constructive, as well as very general.

Inpractice, an object can either be represented by a number of segments in finerlevels of detail or included in a surrounding region at coarser levels ofdetail, and thus a superpixel segmentation hierarchy is useful for applicationsthat require different levels of image segmentation detail depending on theparticular image objects segmented. Unfortunately, there is no method that cangenerate all scales of superpixels accurately in real-time. As a result, asimple yet effective algorithm named Super Hierarchy (SH) is proposed in thispaper. It is as accurate as the state-of-the-art but 1-2 orders of magnitudefaster. The proposed method can be directly integrated with recent efficientedge detectors like the structured forest edges to significantly outperformsthe state-of-the-art in terms of segmentation accuracy. Quantitative andqualitative evaluation on a number of computer vision applications wasconducted, demonstrating that the proposed method is the top performer.

We proposetwo sampling strategies that consist in selecting a small subset of nodes atrandom. The first strategy is non-adaptive, i.e., independent of the graphstructure, and its performance depends on a parameter called the graphcoherence. On the contrary, the second strategy is adaptive but yields optimalresults. Indeed, no more than O(k log(k)) measurements are sufficient to ensurean accurate and stable recovery of all k-bandlimited signals. This secondstrategy is based on a careful choice of the sampling distribution, which canbe estimated quickly. Then, we propose a computationally efficient decoder toreconstruct k-bandlimited signals from their samples. We prove that it yieldsaccurate reconstructions and that it is also stable to noise. Finally, weconduct several experiments to test these techniques.

This algorithm is implemented in a computer program, which computesthe value of $\sigma$ at any reasonable point of the real axis.

A Poisson point process is used todescribe the existence of yet undetected targets, while a multi-Bernoullimixture describes the distribution of the targets that have been detected. Theconjugacy property allows the posterior PMBM density to be computed exactly,meaning that given enough computational power the PMBM filter is correct.However, in practice, the data association problem requires approximations. Theupdate and the prediction of the PMBM density parameters are presented and aregiven interpretations, and a simple linear Gaussian implementation is presentedalong with methods to handle the data association problem. A simulation studyshows that the extended target PMBM filter outperforms the extended targetcardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter in scenarios wherethe expected number of detections per target per time step is low.

This is motivated by the problem of adaptively pickingparameters of learning algorithms as in the recently introduced framework byGupta and Roughgarden (2016). Majority of the machine learning literature hasfocused on Lipschitz-continuous functions or functions with bounded gradients.1 This is with good reason---any learning algorithm suffers linear regret evenagainst piecewise constant functions that are chosen adversarially, arguablythe simplest of non-Lipschitz continuous functions. The smoothed setting weconsider is inspired by the seminal work of Spielman and Teng (2004) and therecent work of Gupta and Roughgarden---in this setting, the sequence offunctions may be chosen by an adversary, however, with some uncertainty in thelocation of discontinuities. We give algorithms that achieve sublinear regretin the full information and bandit settings.

Naming game, on the other hand, is a social communication modelthat simulates the process of learning a name of an object within a communityof humans, where the individuals can reach global consensus on naming an objectasymptotically through iterative pair-wise conversations. The underlyingcommunication network indicates the relationships among the individuals. Inthis paper, three typical topologies of human communication networks, namelyrandom-graph, small-world and scale-free networks, are employed, which areembedded with the multi-local-world community structure, to study the naminggame. Simulations show that 1) when the intra-community connections increasewhile the inter-community connections remain to be unchanged, the convergenceto global consensus is slow and eventually might fail; 2) when theinter-community connections are sufficiently dense, both the number and thesize of the communities do not affect the convergence process; and 3) fordifferent topologies with the same average node-degree, local clustering ofindividuals obstruct or prohibit global consensus to take place. The resultsreveal the role of local communities in a global naming game in social networkstudies.

Hence, it is important to understand how robust is alearning algorithm to such label noise. Experimentally, Decision trees havebeen found to be more robust against label noise than SVM and logisticregression. This paper presents some theoretical results to show that decisiontree algorithms are robust to symmetric label noise under the assumption oflarge sample size. We also present some sample complexity results for thisrobustness. Through extensive simulations we illustrate this robustness.

Zinovyev category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-05-20 summary:Most of machine learning approaches have stemmed from the application ofminimizing the mean squared distance principle, based on the computationallyefficient quadratic optimization methods. However, when faced withhigh-dimensional and noisy data, the quadratic error functionals demonstratemany weaknesses including high sensitivity to contaminating factors anddimensionality curse. Therefore, a lot of recent applications in machinelearning exploited the properties of non-quadratic error functionals based onL1 norm or even sub-linear potentials corresponding to fractional norms. Theback side of these approaches is tremendous increase in computational cost foroptimization. Till so far, no approaches have been suggested to deal with {\itarbitrary} error functionals, in a flexible and computationally efficientframework. In this paper, we develop the theory and basic universal dataapproximation algorithms ($k$-means, principal components, principal manifoldsand graphs), based on piece-wise quadratic error potentials of subquadraticgrowth (PQSQ potentials). We develop a new and universal framework to minimize{\it arbitrary sub-quadratic error potentials} using an algorithm withguaranteed fast convergence to the local or global error minimum. The approachcan be applied in most of existing machine learning methods, including methodsof data approximation and regularized regression, leading to the improvement inthe computational cost/accuracy trade-off.

Unlike traditional kernelmethods, where the kernel is handcrafted or adapted to data in an unsupervisedmanner, we learn how to shape the kernel for a supervised prediction problem.We proceed by generalizing convolutional kernel networks, which originallyprovide unsupervised image representations, and we derive backpropagation rulesto optimize model parameters. As a result, we obtain a new type ofconvolutional neural network with the following properties: (i) at each layer,learning filters is equivalent to optimizing a linear subspace in a reproducingkernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where we project data, (ii) the network may belearned with supervision or without, (iii) the model comes with a naturalregularization function (the norm in the RKHS). We show that our methodachieves reasonably competitive performance on some standard "deep learning"image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and alsostate-of-the-art results for image super-resolution, demonstrating theapplicability of our approach to a large variety of image-related tasks.

This newfamily of variational methods unifies a number of existing approaches, andenables a smooth interpolation from the evidence lower-bound to the logmarginal likelihood that is controlled by the value of alpha that parametrisesthe divergence.

Since only a small subset of MRF isused in computer vision, we characterize this subset with three concepts: (1)Lattice, (2) Homogenity, and (3) Inertia. We design a non-markov high-biaslow-variance model as an alternative to this subclass of MRF. Our goal isrobust learning, from small datasets. Our learning algorithm uses vectorquantization and, at time complexity O(T^d log T^d) for a hypercube of sizeT^d, is much faster than that of MRF.

Guibas category:cs.CV I.5.1, I.2.10 published:2016-05-20 summary:Building discriminative representations for 3D data has been an importanttask in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for avariety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like aplausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexityof 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, sincemost 3D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do notincrease proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting inwasted computation. In this work, we represent 3D spaces as volumetric fields,and propose a novel design that employs field probing filters to efficientlyextract features from them. Each field probing filter is a set of probingpoints --- sensors that perceive the space. Our learning algorithm optimizesnot only the weights associated with the probing points, but also theirlocations, which deforms the shape of the probing filters and adaptivelydistributes them in 3D space. The optimized probing points sense the 3D space"intelligently", rather than operating blindly over the entire domain. We showthat field probing is significantly more efficient than 3DCNNs, while providingstate-of-the-art performance, on classification tasks for 3D object recognitionbenchmark datasets.

However, existing SPSD matrixapproximation methods such as the Nystr\"om method only have weak error bounds.In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation modeland establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model forit has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions havehigh scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable forlarge-scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which theanalysis of its extensions relies. This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and ahighly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for theprototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selectionalgorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimalcolumn selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that theprototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simplecolumn selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose aso-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate whenthe eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement istheoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied toimprove other SPSD matrix approximation models.

The proposed networks are tailored toglioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their verynature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kindof shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of amachine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN whilebeing extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different modelchoices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance.We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data. We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionallyused in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as moreglobal contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from mosttraditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is aconvolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 foldspeed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us totackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, weexplore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated asan additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported onthe 2013 BRATS test dataset reveal that our architecture improves over thecurrently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster.
arxiv-18300-56 | Convergence of Contrastive Divergence with Annealed Learning Rate in Exponential Family | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06220v1.pdf | author:Bai Jiang, Tung-yu Wu, Wing H. Wong category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2016-05-20 summary:In our recent paper, we showed that in exponential family, contrastivedivergence (CD) with fixed learning rate will give asymptotically consistentestimates \cite{wu2016convergence}. In this paper, we establish consistency andconvergence rate of CD with annealed learning rate $\eta_t$. Specifically,suppose CD-$m$ generates the sequence of parameters $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$using an i.i.d. data sample $\mathbf{X}_1^n \sim p_{\theta^*}$ of size $n$,then $\delta_n(\mathbf{X}_1^n) = \limsup_{t \to \infty} \Vert \sum_{s=t_0}^t\eta_s \theta_s / \sum_{s=t_0}^t \eta_s - \theta^* \Vert$ converges inprobability to 0 at a rate of $1/\sqrt[3]{n}$. The number ($m$) of MCMCtransitions in CD only affects the coefficient factor of convergence rate. Ourproof is not a simple extension of the one in \cite{wu2016convergence}. whichdepends critically on the fact that $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a homogeneousMarkov chain conditional on the observed sample $\mathbf{X}_1^n$. Underannealed learning rate, the homogeneous Markov property is not available and wehave to develop an alternative approach based on super-martingales. Experimentresults of CD on a fully-visible $2\times 2$ Boltzmann Machine are provided todemonstrate our theoretical results.
arxiv-18300-57 | Localizing by Describing: Attribute-Guided Attention Localization for Fine-Grained Recognition | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06217v1.pdf | author:Xiao Liu, Jiang Wang, Shilei Wen, Errui Ding, Yuanqing Lin category:cs.CV published:2016-05-20 summary:A key challenge in fine-grained recognition is how to find and representdiscriminative local regions. Recent attention models are capable of learningdiscriminative region localizers only from category labels with reinforcementlearning. However, not utilizing any explicit part information, they are notable to accurately find multiple distinctive regions. In this work, weintroduce an attribute-guided attention localization scheme where the localregion localizers are learned under the guidance of part attributedescriptions. By designing a novel reward strategy, we are able to learn tolocate regions that are spatially and semantically distinctive withreinforcement learning algorithm. The attribute labeling requirement of thescheme is more amenable than the accurate part location annotation required bytraditional part-based fine-grained recognition methods. Experimental resultson the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemeon both fine-grained recognition and attribute recognition.

Inparticular, image and video frame registration is frequently applied incomputer graphics and film production. However, the conventional registrationapproaches usually require long computational time for high quality images andvideo frames. This hinders the applications of the registration approaches inthe modern industries. In this work, we propose a novel approach called {\emTRIM} to accelerate the computations of the registration by triangulating theimages. More specifically, given a high resolution image or video frame, wecompute an optimal coarse triangulation which captures the important featuresof the image. Then, the computation of the registration can be simplified withthe aid of the coarse triangulation. Experimental results suggest that thecomputational time of the registration is significantly reduced using ourtriangulation-based approach, meanwhile the accuracy of the registration iswell retained when compared with the conventional grid-based approach.

Salvador, Hojjat Abdollahi, David Chan, Mohammad H. Mahoor category:cs.CV cs.NE published:2016-05-11 summary:Recognizing facial expression in a wild setting has remained a challengingtask in computer vision. The World Wide Web is a good source of facial imageswhich most of them are captured in uncontrolled conditions. In fact, theInternet is a Word Wild Web of facial images with expressions. This paperpresents the results of a new study on collecting, annotating, and analyzingwild facial expressions from the web. Three search engines were queried using1250 emotion related keywords in six different languages and the retrievedimages were mapped by two annotators to six basic expressions and neutral. Deepneural networks and noise modeling were used in three different trainingscenarios to find how accurately facial expressions can be recognized whentrained on noisy images collected from the web using query terms (e.g. happyface, laughing man, etc)? The results of our experiments show that deep neuralnetworks can recognize wild facial expressions with an accuracy of 82.12%.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trainedend-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semanticsegmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks thattake input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output withefficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fullyconvolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense predictiontasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporaryclassification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fullyconvolutional networks and transfer their learned representations byfine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture thatcombines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearanceinformation from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailedsegmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves improved segmentationof PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFTFlow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for atypical image.

Inspired by the alternating least squares/poweriterations formulation of CCA, and the shift-and-invert preconditioning methodfor PCA, we propose two globally convergent meta-algorithms for CCA, both ofwhich transform the original problem into sequences of least squares problemsthat need only be solved approximately. We instantiate the meta-algorithms withstate-of-the-art SGD methods and obtain time complexities that significantlyimprove upon that of previous work. Experimental results demonstrate theirsuperior performance.
arxiv-18300-62 | Faster Projection-free Convex Optimization over the Spectrahedron | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06203v1.pdf | author:Dan Garber category:math.OC cs.LG published:2016-05-20 summary:Minimizing a convex function over the spectrahedron, i.e., the set of allpositive semidefinite matrices with unit trace, is an important optimizationtask with many applications in optimization, machine learning, and signalprocessing. It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale sincestandard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, isthe conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained muchinterest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specificsetting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrixdecompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvectorcomputation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, theCG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error forminimizing a $\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like$\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is alsostrongly convex. In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convexoptimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the methodis essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a singleeigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\alpha$-strongly convexand $\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the methodafter $t$ iterations is: $$O\left({\min\{\frac{\beta{}}{t},\left({\frac{\beta\sqrt{\textrm{rank}(\textbf{X}^*)}}{\alpha^{1/4}t}}\right)^{4/3},\left({\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\alpha}\lambda_{\min}(\textbf{X}^*)t}}\right)^{2}\}}\right),$$ where $\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,this is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for aCG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouragingpreliminary empirical results.

Specifically for\algo{online-gradient-descent} algorithm we show it has a simple regret boundof \Oh{\sum_{t=1}^T \log (1+ \frac{d_t}{t})}. This gives a clear and simplebound without resorting any distributional and limiting assumptions on thedelays. We further show how this result encompasses and generalizes several ofthe existing known results in the literature. Specifically it matches thecelebrated logarithmic regret \Oh{\log T} when there are no delays (i.e. d_t =1) and regret bound of \Oh{\tau \log T} for constant delays d_t = \tau.

Most research in natural language understanding has focused onlearning from fixed training sets of labeled data, with supervision either atthe word level (tagging, parsing tasks) or sentence level (question answering,machine translation). This kind of supervision is not realistic of how humanslearn, where language is both learned by, and used for, communication. In thiswork, we study dialog-based language learning, where supervision is givennaturally and implicitly in the response of the dialog partner during theconversation. We study this setup in two domains: the bAbI dataset of (Westonet al., 2015) and large-scale question answering from (Dodge et al., 2015). Weevaluate a set of baseline learning strategies on these tasks, and show that anovel model incorporating predictive lookahead is a promising approach forlearning from a teacher's response. In particular, a surprising result is thatit can learn to answer questions correctly without any reward-based supervisionat all.

We make progress on this problem by extending StochasticGradient Variational Bayes (Kingma & Welling, 2013), a 'black box' method forapproximate posterior inference, to stick-breaking priors (Ishwaran & James,2001). This innovation allows us to define deep generative models (DGMs) withinfinite dimensional latent variables. We experimentally demonstrate that DGMswith Dirichlet process priors learn highly discriminative latentrepresentations that are well suited for semi-supervised settings and oftenoutperform the popular Gaussian alternative.

In this paper, we present a hybridarchitecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders(SAE) to learn a sequence of actions that nonlinearly transforms an input shapeor distribution into a target shape or distribution with the same support.While such a framework can be useful in a variety of problems such as roboticpath planning, sequential decision-making in games and identifying materialprocessing pathways to achieve desired microstructures, this paper focuses oncontrolling fluid deformations in a microfluidic channel by deliberatelyplacing a sequence of pillars, which has a significant impact on manufacturingfor biomedical and textile applications where highly targeted shapes aredesired. We propose an architecture which simultaneously predicts theintermediate shape lying in the nonlinear transformation pathway between theundeformed and desired flow shape, then learns the causal action--the singlepillar which results in the deformation of the flow--one at a time. Thelearning of stage-wise transformations provides deep insights into the physicalflow deformation. Results show that under the current framework, our model isable to predict a sequence of pillars that reconstructs the flow shape whichhighly resembles the desired shape.

In this paper, we propose asemantic, class-specific approach to re-rank object proposals, which canconsistently improve the recall performance even with less proposals. We firstextract features for each proposal including semantic segmentation, stereoinformation, contextual information, CNN-based objectness and low-level cue,and then score them using class-specific weights learnt by Structured SVM. Theadvantages of the proposed model are twofold: 1) it can be easily merged toexisting generators with few computational costs, and 2) it can achieve highrecall rate uner strict critical even using less proposals. Experimentalevaluation on the KITTI benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantlyimproves existing popular generators on recall performance. Moreover, in theexperiment conducted for object detection, even with 1,500 proposals, ourapproach can still have higher average precision (AP) than baselines with 5,000proposals.

However, most of the existing methodsencode two sequences with separate encoders, in which a sentence is encodedwith little or no information from the other sentence. In this paper, wepropose a deep architecture to model the strong interaction of sentence pairwith two coupled-LSTMs. Specifically, we introduce two coupled ways to modelthe interdependences of two LSTMs, coupling the local contextualizedinteractions of two sentences. We then aggregate these interactions and use adynamic pooling to select the most informative features. Experiments on twovery large datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture andits superiority to state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we introduce algorithmsable to handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing alower-dimensional SPD manifold. To this end, we propose to model the mappingfrom the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the low-dimensional one with anorthonormal projection. This lets us formulate dimensionality reduction as theproblem of finding a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold eitherwith maximum discriminative power in the supervised scenario, or with maximumvariance of the data in the unsupervised one. We show that learning can beexpressed as an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold and discuss fastsolutions for special cases. Our evaluation on several classification tasksevidences that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain overstate-of-the-art methods.

A prominent medicalapplication of noisy-or Bayesian network is to infer potential diseases givenobserved symptoms. Previous studies focus on approximating a handful ofcomplicated pathological cases using variational transformation. Our goal is touse variational transformation as part of a novel hybridized inference forserving reliable and real time diagnosis at web scale. We propose a hybridizedinference that allows variational parameters to be estimated without diseaseposteriors or priors, making the inference faster and much of its computationrecyclable. In addition, we propose a transformation ranking algorithm that isvery stable to large variances in network prior probabilities, a common issuethat arises in medical applications of Bayesian networks. In experiments, weperform comparative study on a large real life medical network and scalabilitystudy on a much larger (36,000x) synthesized network.

arxiv-18300-73 | Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473v7.pdf | author:Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio category:cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML published:2014-09-01 summary:Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machinetranslation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neuralmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can bejointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposedrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family ofencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence intoa fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In thispaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck inimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, andpropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search forparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this newapproach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existingstate-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-Frenchtranslation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.

Our approachextends traditional topic models by learning a factorized latent variablerepresentation. The structured representation leads to a model that marriesbenefits traditionally associated with a discriminative approach, such asfeature selection, with those of a generative model, such as principledregularization and ability to handle missing data. The factorization isprovided by representing data in terms of aligned pairs of observations asdifferent views. This provides means for selecting a representation thatseparately models topics that exist in both views from the topics that areunique to a single view. This structured consolidation allows for efficient androbust inference and provides a compact and efficient representation. Learningis performed in a Bayesian fashion by maximizing a rigorous bound on thelog-likelihood. Firstly, we illustrate the benefits of the model on a syntheticdataset,. The model is then evaluated in both uni- and multi-modality settingson two different classification tasks with off-the-shelf convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) features which generate state-of-the-art results with extremelycompact representations.

Effective learning in this setting is usually accomplished byspecialized network architectures that are designed to mitigate the vanishinggradient problem of naive deep networks. Many of these architectures, such asLSTMs, GRUs, Highway Networks and Deep Residual Network, are based on a singlestructural principle: the state passthrough. We observe that these architectures, hereby characterized as PassthroughNetworks, in addition to the mitigation of the vanishing gradient problem,enable the decoupling of the network state size from the number of parametersof the network, a possibility that is exploited in some recent works but notthoroughly explored. In this work we propose simple, yet effective, low-rank and low-rank plusdiagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks which exploit thisdecoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory requirements ofthe network while preserving its memory capacity. We present competitiveexperimental results on synthetic tasks and a near state of the art result onsequential randomly-permuted MNIST classification, a hard task on natural data.

Duarte, Mario Parente category:cs.IT cs.LG math.IT published:2015-12-09 summary:Sparse modeling has been widely and successfully used in many applicationssuch as computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition and,accompanied with those applications, significant research has studied thetheoretical limits and algorithm design for convex relaxations in sparsemodeling. However, only little has been done for theoretical limits ofnon-negative versions of sparse modeling. The behavior is expected to besimilar as the general sparse modeling, but a precise analysis has not beenexplored. This paper studies the performance of non-negative sparse modeling,especially for non-negativity constrained and $\ell_1$-penalized least squares,and gives an exact bound for which this problem can recover the correct signalelements. We pose two conditions to guarantee the correct signal recovery:minimum coefficient condition (MCC) and non-linearity vs. subset coherencecondition (NSCC). The former defines the minimum weight for each of the correctatoms present in the signal and the latter defines the tolerable deviation fromthe linear model relative to the positive subset coherence (PSC), a novel typeof "coherence" metric. We provide rigorous performance guarantees based onthese conditions and experimentally verify their precise predictive power in ahyperspectral data unmixing application.

When new data is encountered, the modelsmust inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the newinformation without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmentedmemory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability toquickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviatethe downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of amemory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leveragethis data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We alsointroduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memorycontent, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-basedfocusing mechanisms.

Given a large set of images andthe proximities between all pairs, a similarity score space is defined. Clusteranalysis was applied to the similarity score space to develop varioustaxonomies. Given the number of subjects in the dataset, we used hierarchicalmethods to aggregate images of the same subject. We also explored the hierarchyabove and below the subject level, including clusters that reflect gender andethnicity. Evidence supports the existence of clustering by race, gender,subject, and illumination condition.

Recent studies have shown that the asynchronousstochastic gradient descent (SGD) based algorithms with variance reductionconverge with a linear convergent rate on convex problems. However, there is nowork to analyze asynchronous SGD with variance reduction technique onnon-convex problem. In this paper, we study two asynchronous parallelimplementations of SVRG: one is on a distributed memory system and the other ison a shared memory system. We provide the theoretical analysis that bothalgorithms can obtain a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, and linear speed up isachievable if the number of workers is upper bounded.
arxiv-18300-86 | A Multi-Batch L-BFGS Method for Machine Learning | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06049v1.pdf | author:Albert S. Berahas, Jorge Nocedal, Martin Takáč category:math.OC cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-05-19 summary:The question of how to parallelize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)method has received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we focusinstead on batch methods that use a sizeable fraction of the training set ateach iteration to facilitate parallelism, and that employ second-orderinformation. In order to improve the learning process, we follow a multi-batchapproach in which the batch changes at each iteration. This inherently givesthe algorithm a stochastic flavor that can cause instability in L-BFGS, apopular batch method in machine learning. These difficulties arise becauseL-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian approximations; whenthese gradients are computed using different data points the process can beunstable. This paper shows how to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in themulti-batch setting, illustrates the behavior of the algorithm in a distributedcomputing platform, and studies its convergence properties for both the convexand nonconvex cases.

Neurons in the output space are connected witheach other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning isachieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space.Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structurelimitation they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removalof a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposedcalled AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand createsa more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered duringtraining and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined gridby allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments usingmultiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves trainingperformance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset andprovides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure ofneurons.

Subsequently, we also introducethe evaluation methods for MT evaluation and the recent quality estimationtasks for MT.

We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with word,character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs totraditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present anovel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with anauxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtainsstate-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well formorphologically complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are lesssensitive to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels)than previously assumed.

We test the approach on the Universal DependencyTreebanks, training with MaltParser and MaltOptimizer.

Our approach is inspired from thedouble-opponent cell representation in the human visual cortex. Existingmethods of vectorial total variation regularizers have insufficient (or no)coupling between the color channels and thus may introduce color artifacts. Weaddress this problem by introducing a novel coupling between the color channelsrelated to a pullback-metric from the opponent space to the data (RGB color)space. Our energy is a non-convex, non-smooth higher-order vectorial totalvariation approach and promotes color consistent image filtering via a couplingterm. For a convex variant, we show well-posedness and existence of a solutionin the space of vectorial bounded variation. For the higher-order scheme weemploy a half-quadratic strategy, which model the non-convex energy terms asthe infimum of a sequence of quadratic functions. In experiments, we elaborateon traditional image restoration applications of inpainting, deblurring anddenoising. Regarding the latter, we demonstrate state of the art restorationquality with respect to structure coherence and color consistency.

Assuming mere convexity, weestablish its $O(1/t)$ convergence rate in terms of the objective value andfeasibility measure. The framework includes several existing algorithms asspecial cases such as a primal-dual method for bilinear saddle-point problems(PD-S), the proximal Jacobian ADMM (Prox-JADMM) and a randomized variant of theADMM method for multi-block convex optimization. Our analysis recovers and/orstrengthens the convergence properties of several existing algorithms. Forexample, for PD-S our result leads to the same order of convergence ratewithout the previously assumed boundedness condition on the constraint sets,and for Prox-JADMM the new result provides convergence rate in terms of theobjective value and the feasibility violation. It is well known that theoriginal ADMM may fail to converge when the number of blocks exceeds two. Ourresult shows that if an appropriate randomization procedure is invoked toselect the updating blocks, then a sublinear rate of convergence in expectationcan be guaranteed for multi-block ADMM, without assuming any strong convexity.The new approach is also extended to solve problems where only a stochasticapproximation of the (sub-)gradient of the objective is available, and weestablish an $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ convergence rate of the extended approach forsolving stochastic programming.

The system has anassociative memory based on complex-valued vectors and is closely related toHolographic Reduced Representations and Long Short-Term Memory networks.Holographic Reduced Representations have limited capacity: as they store moreinformation, each retrieval becomes noisier due to interference. Our system incontrast creates redundant copies of stored information, which enablesretrieval with reduced noise. Experiments demonstrate faster learning onmultiple memorization tasks.

Besides the introduction of powerful deepneural networks such as GoogleNet and VGG, novel object detection frameworkssuch as R-CNN and its successors, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, play anessential role in improving the state-of-the-art. Despite their effectivenesson still images, those frameworks are not specifically designed for objectdetection from videos. Temporal and contextual information of videos are notfully investigated and utilized. In this work, we propose a deep learningframework that incorporates temporal and contextual information from tubeletsobtained in videos, which dramatically improves the baseline performance ofexisting still-image detection frameworks when they are applied to videos. Itis called T-CNN, i.e. tubelets with convolutional neueral networks.

French category:cs.CV published:2016-05-19 summary:Recent applications in computer vision have come to heavily rely onsuperpixel over-segmentation as a pre-processing step for higher level visiontasks, such as object recognition, image labelling or image segmentation. Herewe present a new superpixel algorithm called Hierarchical Piecewise-ConstantSuper-regions (HPCS), which not only obtains superpixels comparable to thestate-of-the-art, but can also be applied hierarchically to form what we calln-th order super-regions. In essence, a Markov Random Field (MRF)-basedanisotropic denoising formulation over the quantized feature space is adoptedto form piecewise-constant image regions, which are then combined with agraph-based split & merge post-processing step to form superpixels. The graphand quantized feature based formulation of the problem allows us to generalizeit hierarchically to preserve boundary adherence with fewer superpixels.Experimental results show that, despite the simplicity of our framework, it isable to provide high quality superpixels, and to hierarchically apply them toform layers of over-segmentation, each with a decreasing number of superpixels,while maintaining the same desired properties (such as adherence to strongimage edges). The algorithm is also memory efficient and has a lowcomputational cost.

Jawahar category:cs.CV published:2016-05-19 summary:We address the problem of predicting similarity between a pair of handwrittendocument images written by different individuals. This has applications relatedto matching and mining in image collections containing handwritten content. Asimilarity score is computed by detecting patterns of text re-usages betweendocument images irrespective of the minor variations in word morphology, wordordering, layout and paraphrasing of the content. Our method does not depend onan accurate segmentation of words and lines. We formulate the document matchingproblem as a structured comparison of the word distributions across twodocument images. To match two word images, we propose a convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) based feature descriptor. Performance of this representationsurpasses the state-of-the-art on handwritten word spotting. Finally, wedemonstrate the applicability of our method on a practical problem of matchinghandwritten assignments.

To overcome thisdrawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure that allows to obtain several sparsecomponents with the same sparsity pattern. This allows the practitioner toidentify the original variables which are relevant to describe the data. Tothis end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of PCA and an isotropicGaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation ofthe marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. In order to avoid thedrawbacks of discrete model selection, we propose a simple relaxation of ourframework which allows to find a path of models using a variationalexpectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood caneventually be maximized over this path, relying on Occam's razor to select therelevant variables. Since the sparsity pattern is common to all components, wecall this approach globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA). Its usefulnessis illustrated on synthetic data sets and on several real unsupervised featureselection problems.

We use adeep autoencoder trained to learn the relationship between an image and itsrelated contour, so that the model is able to automatically reconstructcontours from the ultrasound image alone. In this paper, we use an automaticlabelling algorithm instead of time-consuming hand-labelling during thetraining process, and estimate the performances of both automatic labelling andcontour extraction as compared to hand-labelling. Observed results show qualityscores comparable to the state of the art.

Resorting to aGaussian regression framework, we model the impulse response of the unknownlinear system as a realization of a Gaussian process. The structure of thecovariance matrix (or kernel) of such a process is given by the stable splinekernel, which has been recently introduced for system identification purposesand depends on an unknown hyperparameter. We assume that the input can belinearly described by few parameters. We estimate these parameters, togetherwith the kernel hyperparameter and the noise variance, using an empirical Bayesapproach. The related optimization problem is efficiently solved with a noveliterative scheme based on the Expectation-Maximization method. In particular,we show that each iteration consists of a set of simple update rules. We show,through some numerical experiments, very promising performance of the proposedmethod.

Insuch cases however, the influence of the system initial conditions may have asignificant impact on the output dynamics. In this paper, we specificallyaddress this point. We propose three methods that deal with the estimation ofinitial conditions using different types of information. The methods consist invarious mixed maximum likelihood--a posteriori estimators which estimate theinitial conditions and tune the hyperparameters characterizing the stablespline kernel. To solve the related optimization problems, we resort to theexpectation-maximization method, showing that the solutions can be attained byiterating among simple update steps. Numerical experiments show the advantages,in terms of accuracy in reconstructing the system impulse response, of theproposed strategies, compared to other kernel-based schemes not accounting forthe effect initial conditions.

Smeulders category:cs.CV published:2016-05-19 summary:In this paper we present a tracker, which is radically different fromstate-of-the-art trackers: we apply no model updating, no occlusion detection,no combination of trackers, no geometric matching, and still deliverstate-of-the-art tracking performance, as demonstrated on the popular onlinetracking benchmark (OTB) and six very challenging YouTube videos. The presentedtracker simply matches the initial patch of the target in the first frame withcandidates in a new frame and returns the most similar patch by a learnedmatching function. The strength of the matching function comes from beingextensively trained generically, i.e., without any data of the target, using aSiamese deep neural network, which we design for tracking. Once learned, thematching function is used as is, without any adapting, to track previouslyunseen targets. It turns out that the learned matching function is so powerfulthat a simple tracker built upon it, coined Siamese INstance search Tracker,SINT, which only uses the original observation of the target from the firstframe, suffices to reach state-of-the-art performance. Further, we show theproposed tracker even allows for target re-identification after the target wasabsent for a complete video shot.

However due to the lack of control over the quality of theannotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which canpotentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper weintroduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position biasin order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge onthe amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveriesamong all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of thediscoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical developmentrelies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithmsbased on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentiallysuitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supportedby experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposedframework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator'sabnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning,sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc.

Unfortunately, one often has very little or noinformation about the geometry of the space, resulting in a highlyunder-determined recovery problem. Under certain circumstances,state-of-the-art algorithms provide an exact recovery for linear low-rankstructures but at the expense of highly inscalable algorithms which use nuclearnorm. However, the case of non-linear structures remains unresolved. We revisitthe problem of low-rank recovery from a totally different perspective,involving graphs which encode pairwise similarity between the data samples andfeatures. Surprisingly, our analysis confirms that it is possible to recovermany approximate linear and non-linear low-rank structures with recoveryguarantees with a set of highly scalable and efficient algorithms. We call suchdata matrices as \textit{Low-Rank matrices on graphs} and show that many realworld datasets satisfy this assumption approximately due to underlyingstationarity.

While extensive studies have focused ondeveloping methods to improve the classification accuracy, experimental settingand design for method evaluation have drawn little attention. In the scope ofsupervised classification, we find that traditional experimental designs forspectral processing are often improperly used in the spectral-spatialprocessing context, leading to unfair or biased performance evaluation. This isespecially the case when training and testing samples are randomly drawn fromthe same image - a practice that has been commonly adopted in the experiments.Under such setting, the dependence caused by overlap between the training andtesting samples may be artificially enhanced by some spatial informationprocessing methods such as spatial filtering and morphological operation. Suchinteraction between training and testing sets has violated data independenceassumption that is abided by supervised learning theory and performanceevaluation mechanism. Therefore, the widely adopted pixel-based random samplingstrategy is not always suitable to evaluate spectral-spatial classificationalgorithms because it is difficult to determine whether the improvement ofclassification accuracy is caused by incorporating spatial information intoclassifier or by increasing the overlap between training and testing samples.To partially solve this problem, we propose a novel controlled random samplingstrategy for spectral-spatial methods. It can greatly reduce the overlapbetween training and testing samples and provides more objective and accurateevaluation.

The fundamental goal is to simplify the usage and/ordevelopment of ML algorithms, which is especially important in the context oflarge-scale computations. However, ML systems at different abstraction levelshave emerged over time and accordingly there has been a controversy about themeaning of this general definition of declarative ML. Specificationalternatives range from ML algorithms expressed in domain-specific languages(DSLs) with optimization for performance, to ML task (learning problem)specifications with optimization for performance and accuracy. We argue thatthese different types of declarative ML complement each other as they addressdifferent users (data scientists and end users). This paper makes an attempt tocreate a taxonomy for declarative ML, including a definition of essential basicproperties and types of declarative ML. Along the way, we provide insights intoimplications of these properties. We also use this taxonomy to classifyexisting systems. Finally, we draw conclusions on defining appropriatebenchmarks and specification languages for declarative ML.

For the case of two symmetricclusters, we conjecture that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal inthat they detect the clusters as soon as it is information theoreticallypossible to do so. We substantiate this claim for one of the spectralapproaches we introduce.

It isessentially the pre-processing stage of image analysis and computer vision. Inthis work, T1 and T2 weighted brain magnetic resonance images are segmentedusing multilevel thresholding and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO)algorithm. The thresholds are obtained by maximizing the between class variance(multilevel Otsu method) of the image. The BFO algorithm is used to optimizethe threshold searching process. The edges are then obtained from thethresholded image by comparing the intensity of each pixel with its eightconnected neighbourhood. Post processing is performed to remove spuriousresponses in the segmented image. The proposed segmentation technique isevaluated using edge detector evaluation parameters such as figure of merit,Rand Index and variation of information. The proposed brain MR imagesegmentation technique outperforms the traditional edge detectors such as cannyand sobel.

Sabes category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-05-19 summary:Exponential-family harmoniums (EFHs), which extend restricted Boltzmannmachines (RBMs) from Bernoulli random variables to other exponential families(Welling et al., 2005), are generative models that can be trained withunsupervised-learning techniques, like contrastive divergence (Hinton et al.2006; Hinton, 2002), as density estimators for static data. Methods forextending RBMs--and likewise EFHs--to data with temporal dependencies have beenproposed previously (Sutskever and Hinton, 2007; Sutskever et al., 2009), thelearning procedure being validated by qualitative assessment of the generativemodel. Here we propose and justify, from a very different perspective, analternative training procedure, proving sufficient conditions for optimalinference under that procedure. The resulting algorithm can be learned withonly forward passes through the data--backprop-through-time is not required, asin previous approaches. The proof exploits a recent result about informationretention in density estimators (Makin and Sabes, 2015), and applies it to a"recurrent EFH" (rEFH) by induction. Finally, we demonstrate optimality bysimulation, testing the rEFH: (1) as a filter on training data generated with alinear dynamical system, the position of which is noisily reported by apopulation of "neurons" with Poisson-distributed spike counts; and (2) with thequalitative experiments proposed by Sutskever et al. (2009).

Clark, Ales Leonardis, Naveed ur Rehman, Klaus D. McDonald-Maier category:cs.CV published:2016-05-19 summary:Since local feature detection has been one of the most active research areasin computer vision during the last decade, a large number of detectors havebeen proposed. The interest in feature-based applications continues to grow andhas thus rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various featuredetection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the goodpractices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on therepeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of theupper and lower bounds of detector performance and finds statisticallysignificant performance differences between detectors as a function of imagetransformation amount by introducing a new variant of McNemars test in aneffort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. The proposedframework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions forseveral state-of-the-art detectors and to identify their statisticalperformance differences for three specific image transformations: JPEGcompression, uniform light changes and blurring. The results are obtained usinga newly acquired, large image database (20482) images with 539 differentscenes. These results provide new insights into the behaviour of detectors andare also useful from the vision systems design perspective.

Du, Barnabás Póczos category:math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.ML stat.TH published:2016-05-19 summary:Sobolev quantities (norms, inner products, and distances) of probabilitydensity functions are important in the theory of nonparametric statistics, buthave rarely been used in practice, partly due to a lack of practicalestimators. They also include, as special cases, $L^2$ quantities which areused in many applications. We propose and analyze a family of estimators forSobolev quantities of unknown probability density functions. We bound the biasand variance of our estimators over finite samples, finding that they aregenerally minimax rate-optimal. Our estimators are significantly morecomputationally tractable than previous estimators, and exhibit astatistical/computational trade-off allowing them to adapt to computationalconstraints. We also draw theoretical connections to recent work on fasttwo-sample testing. Finally, we empirically validate our estimators onsynthetic data.

Connor, Kristina Shea category:cs.NE math.OC published:2016-05-18 summary:This paper presents an investigation of two search techniques, tabu search(TS) and simulated annealing (SA), to assess their relative merits when appliedto engineering design optimisation. Design optimisation problems are generallycharacterised as having multi-modal search spaces and discontinuities makingglobal optimisation techniques beneficial. Both techniques claim to be capableof locating globally optimum solutions on a range of problems but thiscapability is derived from different underlying philosophies. While tabu searchuses a semi-deterministic approach to escape local optima, simulated annealinguses a complete stochastic approach. The performance of each technique isinvestigated using a structural optimisation problem. These performances arethen compared to each other as and to a steepest descent (SD) method.
arxiv-18300-119 | Beamforming through regularized inverse problems in ultrasound medical imaging | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08184v2.pdf | author:Teodora Szasz, Adrian Basarab, Denis Kouamé category:cs.CV published:2015-07-29 summary:Beamforming in ultrasound imaging has significant impact on the quality ofthe final image, controlling its resolution and contrast. Despite its lowspatial resolution and contrast, delay-and-sum is still extensively usednowadays in clinical applications, due to its real-time capabilities. The mostcommon alternatives are minimum variance method and its variants, whichovercome the drawbacks of delay-and-sum, at the cost of higher computationalcomplexity that limits its utilization in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose to perform beamforming in ultrasound imagingthrough a regularized inverse problem based on a linear model relating thereflected echoes to the signal to be recovered. Our approach presents two majoradvantages: i) its flexibility in the choice of statistical assumptions on thesignal to be beamformed (Laplacian and Gaussian statistics are tested herein)and ii) its robustness to a reduced number of pulse emissions. The proposedframework is flexible and allows for choosing the right trade-off between noisesuppression and sharpness of the resulted image. We illustrate the performanceof our approach on both simulated and experimental data, with \textit{in vivo}examples of carotid and thyroid. Compared to delay-and-sum, minimimum varianceand two other recently published beamforming techniques, our method offersbetter spatial resolution, respectively contrast, when using Laplacian andGaussian priors.
arxiv-18300-120 | The Quality of the Covariance Selection Through Detection Problem and AUC Bounds | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05776v1.pdf | author:Navid Tafaghodi Khajavi, Anthony Kuh category:cs.IT math.IT stat.ML published:2016-05-18 summary:We consider the problem of quantifying the quality of a model selectionproblem for a graphical model. We discuss this by formulating the problem as adetection problem. Model selection problems usually minimize the distance withthe model distribution. For the special case of Gaussian distributions, thisproblem simplifies to the covariance selection problem which is widelydiscussed in literature by Dempster [1] where the Kullback-Leibler (KL)divergence is minimized or equivalently the likelihood criterion maximized tocompute the model covariance matrix. While this solution is optimal forGaussian distributions in the sense of the KL divergence, it is not optimalwhen compared with other information divergences and criteria such as AreaUnder the Curve (AUC). In this paper, we discuss the quality of model approximation using the AUCand its bounds as an average measure of accuracy in detection problem. Wecompute upper and lower bounds for the AUC. We define the correlationapproximation matrix (CAM) and show that the KL divergence and AUC and itsupper and lower bounds depend on the eigenvalues of the CAM. We also show therelationship between the AUC, the KL divergence and the ROC curve by optimizingwith respect to the ROC curve. In the examples provided, we pick treestructures as the simplest graphical models. We perform simulations onfully-connected graphs and compute the tree structured models by applying thewidely used Chow-Liu algorithm. Examples show that the quality of treeapproximation models are not good in general based on information divergences,AUC and its bounds when the number of nodes in the graphical model is large.Specially for 1-AUC, it is shown both in theory and using simulations that the1-AUC for the tree approximation model decays exponentially as the dimension ofthe graphical model increases.

Wedemonstrate how algorithms for optimizing such networks can be adapted tosupervised learning tasks by using matrix product states (tensor trains) toparameterize models for classifying images.

We discuss how the tensor networkform imparts additional structure to the learned model and suggest a possiblegenerative interpretation.

Despite successes with opticalbiopsy for in vivo and in situ tissue characterisation, biopsy retargeting forserial examinations is challenging because tissue may change in appearancebetween examinations. In this paper, we propose an inter-examinationretargeting framework for optical biopsy, based on an image descriptor designedfor matching between endoscopic scenes over significant time intervals. Eachscene is described by a hierarchy of regional intensity comparisons at variousscales, offering tolerance to long-term change in tissue appearance whilstremaining discriminative. Binary coding is then used to compress the descriptorvia a novel random forests approach, providing fast comparisons in Hammingspace and real-time retargeting. Extensive validation conducted on 13 in vivogastrointestinal videos, collected from six patients, show that our approachoutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

GMMis positive definite as there is an associate hashing method named "generalizedconsistent weighted sampling" (GCWS) which linearizes this (nonlinear) kernel.A natural competitor of the GMM kernel is the radial basis function (RBF)kernel, whose corresponding hashing method is known as the "random Fourierfeatures" (RFF). Our classification experiments on public datasets illustratethat both the GMM and RBF kernels can substantially improve linear classifiers.Furthermore, we show that GCWS typically requires substantially fewer samplesthan RFF. We expect that GMM and GCWS will be adopted in practice forlarge-scale machine learning applications and near neighbor search.

Our approach focuses on the first stage of many stereo algorithms: thematching cost computation. We approach the problem by learning a similaritymeasure on small image patches using a convolutional neural network. Trainingis carried out in a supervised manner by constructing a binary classificationdata set with examples of similar and dissimilar pairs of patches. We examinetwo network architectures for this task: one tuned for speed, the other foraccuracy. The output of the convolutional neural network is used to initializethe stereo matching cost. A series of post-processing steps follow: cross-basedcost aggregation, semiglobal matching, a left-right consistency check, subpixelenhancement, a median filter, and a bilateral filter. We evaluate our method onthe KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury stereo data sets and show that itoutperforms other approaches on all three data sets.

Salman Avestimehr, Antonio Ortega category:cs.LG published:2016-05-18 summary:This paper studies graph-based active learning, where the goal is toreconstruct a binary signal defined on the nodes of a weighted graph, bysampling it on a small subset of the nodes. A new sampling algorithm isproposed, which sequentially selects the graph nodes to be sampled, based on anaggressive search for the boundary of the signal over the graph. The algorithmgeneralizes a recent method for sampling nodes in unweighted graphs. Thegeneralization improves the sampling performance using the information gainedfrom the available graph weights. An analysis of the number of samples requiredby the proposed algorithm is provided, and the gain over the unweighted methodis further demonstrated in simulations. Additionally, the proposed method iscompared with an alternative state of-the-art method, which is based on thegraph's spectral properties. It is shown that the proposed method significantlyoutperforms the spectral sampling method, if the signal needs to be predictedwith high accuracy. On the other hand, if a higher level of inaccuracy istolerable, then the spectral method outperforms the proposed aggressive searchmethod. Consequently, we propose a hybrid method, which is shown to combine theadvantages of both approaches.
arxiv-18300-126 | Online Algorithms For Parameter Mean And Variance Estimation In Dynamic Regression Models | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05697v1.pdf | author:Carlos Alberto Gomez-Uribe category:stat.ML published:2016-05-18 summary:We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model froma set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. Theresponse is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model ofunknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated areassumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where theparameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for manyapplications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation withadditive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications,particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the systemstate it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive anapproximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of theparameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. Thisalgorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. Wespecialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution toobtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because thecommon regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponentialand multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential familydistribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online meanand variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in thecontext of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use thesealgorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far modelparameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian orBernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithmsdescribed here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resultingperformance on a simulation.

An important property ofhyperspectral images is that the patch manifold, which is sampled by thethree-dimensional blocks in the data cube, is generally of a low dimensionalnature. This is a generalization of low-rank models in that hyperspectralimages with nonlinear mixing terms can also fit in this framework. The pointintegral method (PIM) is used to solve a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a pointcloud sampling the patch manifold in LDMM. Both numerical simulations andtheoretical analysis show that the sample points constraint is correctlyenforced by PIM. The framework is demonstrated by experiments on thereconstruction of both linear and nonlinear mixed hyperspectral images with asignificant number of missing voxels and several entirely missing spectralbands.

We assume that in a technical system several processesinteract. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model theobservations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, thecomponents of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to theprocesses in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge inthe technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As aconsequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation ofthe model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used forclassification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of themodels' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-densityregions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-densityregions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focuson the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requiresdifferent detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique todetect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast onlinegoodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine thisapproach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented inpreliminary work. The properties of CANDIES are evaluated using artificial dataand benchmark data from the field of intrusion detection in computer networks,where the task is to detect new kinds of attacks.

Incorporating sparsity in the precisionmatrix allows the Gaussian variational distribution to be both flexible andparsimonious, and the sparsity is achieved through parameterization in terms ofthe Cholesky factor. Efficient stochastic gradient methods which makeappropriate use of gradient information for the target distribution aredeveloped for the optimization. We consider alternative estimators of thestochastic gradients which have lower variation and are more stable. Ourapproach is illustrated using generalized linear mixed models and state spacemodels for time series.

Linguistic and neurocognitive studies recognize the phonologicalclasses at segmental level as the essential and invariant representations usedin speech temporal organization. In the context of speech processing, a deepneural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer theprobability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speechsignal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to asphonological posterior. There are only very few classes comprising a short termspeech signal; hence, the phonological posterior is a sparse vector. Althoughthe phonological posteriors are estimated at segmental level, we claim thatthey convey supra-segmental information. Specifically, we demonstrate thatphonological posteriors are indicative of syllabic and prosodic events.Building on findings from converging linguistic evidence on the gestural modelof Articulatory Phonology as well as the neural basis of speech perception, wehypothesize that phonological posteriors convey properties of linguisticclasses at multiple time scales, and this information is embedded in theirsupport (index) of active coefficients. To verify this hypothesis, we obtain abinary representation of phonological posteriors at the segmental level whichis referred to as first-order sparsity structure; the high-order structures areobtained by the concatenation of first-order binary vectors. It is thenconfirmed that the classification of supra-segmental linguistic events, theproblem known as linguistic parsing, can be achieved with high accuracy usingasimple binary pattern matching of first-order or high-order structures.

Robert category:stat.ME stat.CO stat.ML published:2016-05-18 summary:Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has grown into a standard methodologyto handle Bayesian inference in models associated with intractable likelihoodfunctions. Most ABC implementations require the selection of a summarystatistic as the data itself is too large or too complex to be compared tosimulated realisations from the assumed model. The dimension of this statisticis generally constrained to be close to the dimension of the model parameterfor efficiency reasons. Furthermore, the tolerance level that governs theacceptance or rejection of parameter values needs to be calibrated and therange of calibration techniques available so far is mostly based on asymptoticarguments. We propose here to conduct Bayesian inference based on anarbitrarily large vector of summary statistics without imposing a selection ofthe relevant components and bypassing the derivation of a tolerance. Theapproach relies on the random forest methodology of Breiman (2001) when appliedto regression. We advocate the derivation of a new random forest for eachcomponent of the parameter vector, a tool from which an approximation to themarginal posterior distribution can be derived. Correlations between parametercomponents are handled by separate random forests. This technology offerssignificant gains in terms of robustness to the choice of the summarystatistics and of computing time, when compared with more standard ABCsolutions.
arxiv-18300-137 | Characteristic Kernels and Infinitely Divisible Distributions | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7304v2.pdf | author:Yu Nishiyama, Kenji Fukumizu category:stat.ML published:2014-03-28 summary:We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely divisibledistributions on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic kernels play an importantrole in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguishany two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is two-fold.First, we show, using the L\'evy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariantkernel given by a bounded, continuous and symmetric probability densityfunction (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ ischaracteristic. We also present some closure property of such characteristickernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, indeveloping various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute thefollowing values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and(ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\left\langle m_P, m_Q \right\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}}$, for probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$are Gaussians, then computation (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that istractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in theclass of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a {\itconjugate} kernel and {\it convolution trick}, so that the above (i) and (ii)have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases.As specific instances, we explore $\alpha$-stable distributions and a richclass of generalized hyperbolic distributions, where the Laplace, Cauchy andStudent-t distributions are included.

In particular, selecting a good activation function (possibly in adata-dependent fashion) is a crucial step, which remains an open problem in theresearch community. Despite a large amount of investigations, most currentimplementations simply select one fixed function from a small set ofcandidates, which is not adapted during training, and is shared among allneurons throughout the different layers. However, neither two of theseassumptions can be supposed optimal in practice. In this paper, we present aprincipled way to have data-dependent adaptation of the activation functions,which is performed independently for each neuron. This is achieved byleveraging over past and present advances on cubic spline interpolation,allowing for local adaptation of the functions around their regions of use. Theresulting algorithm is relatively cheap to implement, and overfitting iscounterbalanced by the inclusion of a novel damping criterion, which penalizesunwanted oscillations from a predefined shape. Experimental results validatethe proposal over two well-known benchmarks.

We assume that the nonlinear functioncan be described as a linear combination of $p$ basis functions. We reconstructthe $p$ coefficients of the nonlinearity together with the first $n$ samples ofthe impulse response of the linear system by estimating an $np$-dimensionaloverparameterized vector, which contains all the combinations of the unknownvariables. To avoid high variance in these estimates, we adopt a regularizedkernel-based approach and, in particular, we introduce a new kernel tailoredfor Hammerstein system identification. We show that the resulting schemeprovides an estimate of the overparameterized vector that can be uniquelydecomposed as the combination of an impulse response and $p$ coefficients ofthe static nonlinearity. We also show, through several numerical experiments,that the proposed method compares very favorably with two standard methods forHammerstein system identification.

Generally discovery algorithms can be divided into two approaches:constraint-based and score-based. The constraint-based approach is able todetect common causes of the observed variables but the use of independencetests makes it less reliable. The score-based approach produces a result thatis easier to interpret as it also measures the reliability of the inferredcausal relationships, but it is unable to detect common confounders of theobserved variables. A drawback of both score-based and constrained-basedapproaches is the inherent instability in structure estimation. With finitesamples small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimalstructures. The present work introduces a new hypothesis-free score-basedcausal discovery algorithm that is robust for finite samples based on recentadvances in stability selection using subsampling and selection algorithms.Structure search is performed over Structural Equation Models. Our approachuses exploratory search but allows incorporation of prior background knowledge.We validated our approach on one simulated data set, which we compare to theknown the ground truth, and two real-world data sets for Chronic FatigueSyndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which we compare toearlier medical studies. The result on the simulated data set shows accuratestructure estimates and the results on the real-word data sets show consistencywith the hypothesis driven models constructed by medical experts.

Purvis category:cs.CV published:2016-05-18 summary:This paper investigates the problem of image segmentation using superpixels.We propose two approaches to enhance the discriminative ability of thesuperpixel's covariance descriptors. In the first one, we employ theLog-Euclidean distance as the metric on the covariance manifolds, and then usethe RBF kernel to measure the similarities between covariance descriptors. Thesecond method is focused on extracting the subspace structure of the set ofcovariance descriptors by extending a low rank representation algorithm on tothe covariance manifolds. Experiments are carried out with the BerklySegmentation Dataset, and compared with the state-of-the-art segmentationalgorithms, both methods are competitive.

Along with the advent of deep convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN), using contextual information with such systems starts toreceive attention in the literature. At the same time, aerial imagery isgaining momentum. While advances in deep learning make good progress in aerialimage analysis, this problem still poses many great challenges. Aerial imagesare often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolutionobjects, many times occluded by trees or taller buildings. In this domain, inparticular, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very fewpapers that consider context in aerial image understanding. Here we introducecontext as a complementary way of recognizing objects. We propose a dual-streamdeep neural network model that processes information along two independentpathways, one for local and another for global visual reasoning. The two arelater combined in the final layers of processing. Our model learns to combinelocal object appearance as well as information from the larger scene at thesame time and in a complementary way, such that together they form a powerfulclassifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of segmentation ofbuildings and roads in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on theMassachusetts Buildings Dataset. We also introduce two new datasets, forbuildings and road segmentation, respectively, and study the relativeimportance of local appearance vs. the larger scene, as well as theirperformance in combination. While our local-global model could also be usefulin general recognition tasks, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness ofvisual context in conjunction with deep nets for aerial image understanding.

The TLP method is formulated in the Bayesian framework with aspatial and a temporal dynamic programming (DP) algorithms inferring objectbounding boxes on-the-fly. During online learning, the AOG is discriminativelylearned using latent SVM to account for appearance (e.g., lighting and partialocclusion) and structural (e.g., different poses and viewpoints) variations ofa tracked object, as well as distractors (e.g., similar objects) in background.Three key issues in online inference and learning are addressed: (i)maintaining purity of positive and negative examples collected online, (ii)controling model complexity in latent structure learning, and (iii) identifyingcritical moments to re-learn the structure of AOG based on its intrackability.The intrackability measures uncertainty of an AOG based on its score maps in aframe. In experiments, our AOGTracker is tested on two popular trackingbenchmarks with the same parameter setting: the TB-100/50/CVPR2013 benchmarks,and the VOT benchmarks --- VOT 2013, 2014, 2015 and TIR2015 (thermal imagerytracking). In the former, our AOGTracker outperforms state-of-the-art trackingalgorithms including two trackers based on deep convolutional network. In thelatter, our AOGTracker outperforms all other trackers in VOT2013 and iscomparable to the state-of-the-art methods in VOT2014, 2015 and TIR2015.

However, most works on video captioning are focused ongenerating single input of aggregated features, which hardly deviates fromimage captioning process and does not fully take advantage of dynamic contentspresent in videos. We attempt to generate video captions that convey richercontents by temporally segmenting the video with action localization,generating multiple captions from multiple frames, and connecting them withnatural language processing techniques, in order to generate a story-likecaption. We show that our proposed method can generate captions that are richerin contents and can compete with state-of-the-art method without explicitlyusing video-level features as input.

The prescriptive price optimization first builds sales forecastformulas of multiple products, on the basis of historical data, which revealcomplex relationships between sales and prices, such as price elasticity ofdemand and cannibalization. Then, it constructs a mathematical optimizationproblem on the basis of those predictive formulas. We present that theoptimization problem can be formulated as an instance of binary quadraticprogramming (BQP). Although BQP problems are NP-hard in general andcomputationally intractable, we propose a fast approximation algorithm using asemi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation, which is closely related to theGoemans-Williamson's Max-Cut approximation. Our experiments on simulation andreal retail datasets show that our prescriptive price optimizationsimultaneously derives the optimal prices of tens/hundreds products withpractical computational time, that potentially improve 8.2% of gross profit ofthose products.

We propose a simpleapproach that leverages the descriptions of entities or phrases available inlexical resources, in conjunction with distributional semantics, in order toderive a better initialization for training relational models. Applying thisinitialization to the TransE model results in significant new state-of-the-artperformances on the WordNet dataset, decreasing the mean rank from the previousbest of 212 to 51. It also results in faster convergence of the entityrepresentations. We find that there is a trade-off between improving the meanrank and the hits@10 with this approach. This illustrates that much remains tobe understood regarding performance improvements in relational models.

Many previous works argue that recognitionperformance based completely on the gait feature is limited. The reason forthis limited performance remains unclear. This study focuses on humanrecognition with gait feature obtained by Kinect and shows that gait featurecan effectively distinguish from different human beings through a novelrepresentation -- relative distance-based gait features. Experimental resultsshow that the recognition accuracy with relative distance features reaches upto 85%, which is comparable with that of anthropometric features. Thecombination of relative distance features and anthropometric features canprovide an accuracy of more than 95%. Results indicate that the relativedistance feature is quite effective and worthy of further study in more generalscenarios (e.g., without Kinect).

Recent work has proposed Next-Utterance-Classification (NUC) as asurrogate task for building dialogue systems from text data. In this paper weinvestigate the performance of humans on this task to validate the relevance ofNUC as a method of evaluation. Our results show three main findings: (1) humansare able to correctly classify responses at a rate much better than chance,thus confirming that the task is feasible, (2) human performance levels varyacross task domains (we consider 3 datasets) and expertise levels (novice vsexperts), thus showing that a range of performance is possible on this type oftask, (3) automated dialogue systems built using state-of-the-art machinelearning methods have similar performance to the human novices, but worse thanthe experts, thus confirming the utility of this class of tasks for drivingfurther research in automated dialogue systems.
arxiv-18300-151 | Are Facial Attributes Adversarially Robust? | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05411v1.pdf | author:Andras Rozsa, Manuel Günther, Ethan M. Rudd, Terrance E. Boult category:cs.CV published:2016-05-18 summary:Facial attributes are emerging soft biometrics that have the potential toreject non-matches, for example, based on on mismatching gender. To be usablein stand-alone systems, facial attributes must be extracted from imagesautomatically and reliably. In this paper we propose a simple yet effectivesolution for automatic facial attribute extraction by training a deepconvolutional neural network (DCNN) for each facial attribute separately,without using any pre-training or dataset augmentation, and we obtain newstate-of-the-art facial attribute classification results on the CelebAbenchmark. To test the stability of the networks, we generated adversarialimages via a novel fast flipping attribute (FFA) technique. We show that FFAgenerates more adversarials than other related algorithms, and that the DCNNsfor certain attributes are generally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNsfor other attributes are not. This result is surprising because no DCNNs testedto date have exhibited robustness to adversarial images without explicitaugmentation in the training procedure to account for adversarial examples.Finally, we introduce the concept of natural adversarial images, i.e., imagesthat are misclassified but can be easily turned into correctly classifiedimages by applying small perturbations. We demonstrate that naturaladversarials commonly occur, even within the training set, and show that mostof these images remain misclassified even with additional training epochs. Thisphenomenon is surprising because correcting the misclassification, particularlywhen guided by training data, should require only a small adjustment to theDCNN parameters.

Boult category:cs.LG published:2015-06-19 summary:It is often desirable to be able to recognize when inputs to a recognitionfunction correspond to classes unseen at training time. With this ability,these inputs could be re-labeled by a human, and later incorporated into therecognition function -- ideally under an efficient incremental updatemechanism. While good models that assume inputs from a fixed set of classesexist, e.g., artificial neural networks and kernel machines, it is notimmediately obvious how to extend them to perform incremental learning in thepresence of unknown query classes. Models that do so take little otherdistributional information into account when constructing recognition functionsand lack strong theoretical foundations. We take steps to address this gap byformulating a novel, theoretically grounded classifier -- the Extreme ValueMachine (EVM) -- which is capable of performing open world recognition. The EVMhas a well-grounded interpretation derived from statistical extreme valuetheory (EVT), and is the first classifier of its kind to be able to performnonlinear, kernel-free, variable bandwidth, incremental learning. Wedemonstrate experimentally that, compared to other classifiers in the same deepnetwork derived feature space, the EVM is accurate and efficient on anestablished benchmark partition of the ImageNet dataset.

Vu, Vishal Monga category:cs.CV published:2016-01-31 summary:Despite the fact that different objects possess distinct class-specificfeatures, they also usually share common patterns. Inspired by thisobservation, we propose a novel method to explicitly and simultaneously learn aset of common patterns as well as class-specific features for classification.Our dictionary learning framework is hence characterized by both a shareddictionary and particular (class-specific) dictionaries. For the shareddictionary, we enforce a low-rank constraint, i.e. claim that its spanningsubspace should have low dimension and the coefficients corresponding to thisdictionary should be similar. For the particular dictionaries, we impose onthem the well-known constraints stated in the Fisher discrimination dictionarylearning (FDDL). Further, we propose a new fast and accurate algorithm to solvethe sparse coding problems in the learning step, accelerating its convergence.The said algorithm could also be applied to FDDL and its extensions.Experimental results on widely used image databases establish the advantages ofour method over state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.

However, in recentyears generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have beendeveloped to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deepconvolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generatehighly compelling images of specific categories such as faces, album covers,room interiors etc. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GANformulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image modeling,translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate thecapability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers fromdetailed text descriptions.

In theseformulations the current best complement to visual features are attributes:manually encoded vectors describing shared characteristics among categories.Despite good performance, attributes have limitations: (1) finer-grainedrecognition requires commensurately more attributes, and (2) attributes do notprovide a natural language interface. We propose to overcome these limitationsby training neural language models from scratch; i.e. without pre-training andonly consuming words and characters. Our proposed models train end-to-end toalign with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images. Naturallanguage provides a flexible and compact way of encoding only the salientvisual aspects for distinguishing categories. By training on raw text, ourmodel can do inference on raw text as well, providing humans a familiar modeboth for annotation and retrieval. Our model achieves strong performance onzero-shot text-based image retrieval and significantly outperforms theattribute-based state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the CaltechUCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset.

Lakshminarayanan, Sahil Sharma, Balaraman Ravindran category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE published:2016-05-17 summary:Deep Reinforcement Learning methods have achieved state of the artperformance in learning control policies for the games in the Atari 2600domain. One of the important parameters in the Arcade Learning Environment(ALE) is the frame skip rate. It decides the granularity at which agents cancontrol game play. A frame skip value of $k$ allows the agent to repeat aselected action $k$ number of times. The current state of the art architectureslike Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dueling Network Architectures (DuDQN) consist ofa framework with a static frame skip rate, where the action output from thenetwork is repeated for a fixed number of frames regardless of the currentstate. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Dynamic Frame skip DeepQ-Network (DFDQN) which makes the frame skip rate a dynamic learnableparameter. This allows us to choose the number of times an action is to berepeated based on the current state. We show empirically that such a settingimproves the performance on relatively harder games like Seaquest.

More specifically, the proposed lossfunction penalizes the L1-norm of the gradient of the label probability vectorimage , i.e. total variation, produced by the ConvNet. This can be seen as aregularization term that promotes piecewise smoothness of the label probabilityvector image produced by the ConvNet during learning. The unsupervised lossfunction is combined with a supervised loss in a semi-supervised setting tolearn ConvNets that can achieve high semantic segmentation accuracy even whenonly a tiny percentage of the pixels in the training images are labeled. Wedemonstrate significant improvements over the purely supervised setting in theWeizmann horse, Stanford background and Sift Flow datasets. Furthermore, weshow that using the proposed piecewise smoothness constraint in the learningphase significantly outperforms post-processing results from a purelysupervised approach with Markov Random Fields (MRF). Finally, we note that theframework we introduce is general and can be used to learn to label other typesof structures such as curvilinear structures by modifying the unsupervised lossfunction accordingly.

Lakshminarayanan, Peeyush Kumar, Balaraman Ravindran category:cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE published:2016-05-17 summary:This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework inreinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description ofthe given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions betweenabstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides waysto simplify and speed up reinforcement learning learning algorithms. Thesestructures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks withoutrelearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to findmetastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states.The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitableabstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in termsof the transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity informationfrom PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. The skills areindependent of the learning task and can be efficiently reused across a varietyof tasks defined over a common state space. Another major advantage of theapproach is that it does not need a prior model of the MDP and can work welleven when the MDPs are constructed from sampled trajectories. Finally, wepresent our attempts to extend the automated skills acquisition framework tocomplex tasks such as learning to play video games where we use deep learningtechniques for representation learning to aid our spatio-temporal abstractionframework.

While the exact factorization of a given order may not existand is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving anoptimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtainedthrough the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace ofthe estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using suchfactorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing ablock-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connectedcomponents of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for communitydetection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degreecorrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysisshow the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations,including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectralclustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state ofthe art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogsand the karate club data.

Such tasks include simplereporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicalityof such analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with afundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy. In this paper, we study this trade-off in the context of a specific domain,Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). Our choice of this domain is influencedby its commonalities with several other domains that produce real-time data,our access to a large live dataset, and their real-time nature anddimensionality which makes it a natural fit for a popular analysis technique,machine learning (ML). We find that the latency accuracy trade-off can beresolved using two broad, general techniques: intelligent data grouping andtask formulations that leverage domain characteristics. Based on this, wepresent CellScope, a system that addresses this challenge by applying a domainspecific formulation and application of Multi-task Learning (MTL) to RANperformance analysis. It achieves this goal using three techniques: featureengineering to transform raw data into effective features, a PCA inspiredsimilarity metric to group data from geographically nearby base stationssharing performance commonalities, and a hybrid online-offline model forefficient model updates. Our evaluation of CellScope shows that its accuracyimprovements over direct application of ML range from 2.5x to 4.4x whilereducing the model update overhead by up to 4.8x. We have also used CellScopeto analyze a live LTE consisting of over 2 million subscribers for a period ofover 10 months, where it uncovered several problems and insights, some of thempreviously unknown.

Sarwate category:cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML published:2016-05-17 summary:Dictionary learning is the problem of estimating the collection of atomicelements that provide a sparse representation of measured/collected signals ordata. This paper finds fundamental limits on the sample complexity ofestimating dictionaries for tensor data by proving a lower bound on the minimaxrisk. This lower bound depends on the dimensions of the tensor and parametersof the generative model. The focus of this paper is on second-order tensordata, with the underlying dictionaries constructed by taking the Kroneckerproduct of two smaller dictionaries and the observed data generated by sparselinear combinations of dictionary atoms observed through white Gaussian noise.In this regard, the paper provides a general lower bound on the minimax riskand also adapts the proof techniques for equivalent results using sparse andGaussian coefficient models. The reported results suggest that the samplecomplexity of dictionary learning for tensor data can be significantly lowerthan that for unstructured data.

Percival category:stat.ME stat.CO stat.ML published:2016-05-17 summary:This paper provides an algorithm for simulating improper (or noncircular)complex-valued stationary Gaussian processes. The technique utilizes recentlydeveloped methods for multivariate Gaussian processes from the circulantembedding literature. The method can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(nlog_2n)$operations, where n is the length of the desired sequence. The method is exact,except when eigenvalues of prescribed circulant matrices are negative. Weevaluate the performance of the algorithm empirically, and provide a practicalexample where the method is guaranteed to be exact for all $n$, with animproper fractional Gaussian noise process.

Evenlow-cost consumer-grade webcams can be used for gaze tracking without anyadditional hardware. A two-stage algorithm is proposed for iris centrelocalization. The proposed method uses geometrical characteristics of the eye.In the first stage, a fast convolution based approach is used for obtaining thecoarse location of iris centre (IC). The IC location is further refined in thesecond stage using boundary tracing and ellipse fitting. The algorithm has beenevaluated in public databases like BioID, Gi4E and is found to outperform thestate of the art methods.

Knowledge of gaze direction can give valuable information regardingusers point of attention. Certain patterns of eye movements known as eyeaccessing cues are reported to be related to the cognitive processes in thehuman brain. We propose a real-time framework for the classification of eyegaze direction and estimation of eye accessing cues. In the first stage, thealgorithm detects faces using a modified version of the Viola-Jones algorithm.A rough eye region is obtained using geometric relations and facial landmarks.The eye region obtained is used in the subsequent stage to classify the eyegaze direction. A convolutional neural network is employed in this work for theclassification of eye gaze direction. The proposed algorithm was tested on EyeChimera database and found to outperform state of the art methods. Thecomputational complexity of the algorithm is very less in the testing phase.The algorithm achieved an average frame rate of 24 fps in the desktopenvironment.

Wepresent a new biologically-inspired AMC method without the need for models ormanually specified features --- thus removing the requirement for expert priorknowledge. We accomplish this task using regularized stacked sparse denoisingautoencoders (SSDAs). Our method selects efficient classification featuresdirectly from raw in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) radio signals in an unsupervisedmanner. These features are then used to construct higher-complexity abstractfeatures which can be used for automatic modulation classification. Wedemonstrate this process using a dataset generated with a software definedradio, consisting of random input bits encoded in 100-sample segments ofvarious common digital radio modulations. Our results show correctclassification rates of > 99% at 7.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and > 92%at 0 dB SNR in a 6-way classification test. Our experiments demonstrate adramatically new and broadly applicable mechanism for performing AMC andrelated tasks without the need for expert-defined or modulation-specific signalinformation.

The algorithm onlineoptimizes the objective function which simultaneously controls the depth of thetree and its statistical accuracy. We prove important properties of thisobjective and explore its connection to three well-known entropy-based decisiontree objectives, i.e. Shannon entropy, Gini-entropy and its modified version,for which instead online optimization schemes were not yet developed. We show,via boosting-type guarantees, that maximizing the considered objective leadsalso to the reduction of all of these entropy-based objectives. The bounds weobtain critically depend on the strong-concavity properties of theentropy-based criteria, where the mildest dependence on the number of classes(only logarithmic) corresponds to the Shannon entropy.

In last severalyears, the compressed sensing approach to solving this problem was advanced,which promises reducing the number of required measurements by means ofobtaining sparse approximations of images. However, the number of measurementsrequired by compressive sensing substantially exceeds the theoretical minimumdefined by sparsity of the image sparse approximation. In the paper, a samplingtheory based method of image sampling is suggested that represents a practicaland substantially more economical alternative to the compressed sensingapproach. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verificationof the method, its possible applicability extensions and some its limitations.

Research inevolving activation functions has mainly focused on evolving functionparameters, and developing heterogeneous networks by selecting from a fixedpool of activation functions. This paper introduces a novel technique forevolving heterogeneous artificial neural networks through combinatoriallygenerating piecewise activation functions to enhance expressive power. Idemonstrate this technique on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies usingArcTan and Sigmoid, and show that it outperforms the original algorithm onnon-Markovian double pole balancing. This technique expands the landscape ofunconventional activation functions by demonstrating that they are competitivewith canonical choices, and introduces a purview for further exploration ofautomatic model selection for artificial neural networks.

We first introduce an effective method for extracting human tubes bycombining a state-of-the-art human detector with a tracking-by-detectionapproach. Our tube extraction leverages the large amount of annotated humansavailable today and outperforms the state of the art by an order of magnitude:with less than 5 tubes per video, we obtain a recall of 95% on the UCF-Sportsand J-HMDB datasets. Given these human tubes, we perform weakly-supervisedselection based on multi-fold Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with improveddense trajectories and achieve excellent results. We obtain a mAP of 84% onUCF-Sports, 54% on J-HMDB and 45% on UCF-101, which outperforms the state ofthe art for weakly-supervised action localization and is close to theperformance of the best fully-supervised approaches. The second contribution of this paper is a new realistic dataset for actionlocalization, named DALY (Daily Action Localization in YouTube). It containshigh quality temporal and spatial annotations for 10 actions in 31 hours ofvideos (3.3M frames), which is an order of magnitude larger than standardaction localization datasets. On the DALY dataset, our tubes have a spatialrecall of 82%, but the detection task is extremely challenging, we obtain 10.8%mAP.

However, the 140character limit imposed on tweets makes it hard to use standard linguisticmethods for sentiment classification. On the other hand, what tweets lack instructure they make up with sheer volume and rich metadata. This metadataincludes geolocation, temporal and author information. We hypothesize thatsentiment is dependent on all these contextual factors. Different locations,times and authors have different emotional valences. In this paper, we exploredthis hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions oflabelled tweets from different locations, times and authors. We used this datato analyse the variation of tweet sentiments across different authors, timesand locations. Once we explored and understood the relationship between thesevariables and sentiment, we used a Bayesian approach to combine these variableswith more standard linguistic features such as n-grams to create a Twittersentiment classifier. This combined classifier outperforms the purelylinguistic classifier, showing that integrating the rich contextual informationavailable on Twitter into sentiment classification is a promising direction ofresearch.

Many image simplification andsegmentation methods are driven by the optimization of an energy functional,for instance the celebrated Mumford-Shah functional. In this paper, we proposean efficient approach to hierarchical image simplification and segmentationbased on the minimization of the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional.This method conforms to the current trend that consists in producinghierarchical results rather than a unique partition. Contrary to classicalapproaches which compute optimal hierarchical segmentations from an inputhierarchy of segmentations, we rely on the tree of shapes, a unique andwell-defined representation equivalent to the image. Simply put, we compute foreach level line of the image an attribute function that characterizes itspersistence under the energy minimization. Then we stack the level lines frommeaningless ones to salient ones through a saliency map based on extinctionvalues defined on the tree-based shape space. Qualitative illustrations andquantitative evaluation on Weizmann segmentation evaluation databasedemonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

In this paper, we introduce a Deep Learning regression architecture forstructured prediction of 3D human pose from monocular images that relies on anovercomplete auto-encoder to learn a high-dimensional latent poserepresentation and account for joint dependencies. We demonstrate that ourapproach outperforms state-of-the-art ones both in terms of structurepreservation and prediction accuracy.

As a consequence, and aided bythe public nature of Twitter, political scientists now potentially have themeans to analyse and understand the narratives that organically form, spreadand decline among the public in a political campaign. However, the volume anddiversity of the conversation on Twitter, combined with its noisy andidiosyncratic nature, make this a hard task. Thus, advanced data mining andlanguage processing techniques are required to process and analyse the data. Inthis paper, we present and evaluate a technical framework, based on recentadvances in deep neural networks, for identifying and analysingelection-related conversation on Twitter on a continuous, longitudinal basis.Our models can detect election-related tweets with an F-score of 0.92 and cancategorize these tweets into 22 topics with an F-score of 0.90.

Traditionally, aneGFR time series is interpreted by a human expert labelling it as stable orunstable. While this approach works for individual patients, the time consumingnature of it precludes the quick evaluation of risk in large numbers ofpatients. However, automating this process poses significant challenges as eGFRmeasurements are usually recorded at irregular intervals and the series ofmeasurements differs in length between patients. Here we present a two-tiersystem to automatically classify an eGFR trend. First, we model the time seriesusing Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fill in `gaps' by resampling a fixedsize vector of fifty time-dependent observations. Second, we classify theresampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate itsperformance via 5-fold cross validation. Using this approach we achieved anF-score of 0.90, compared to 0.96 for 5 human experts when scored amongstthemselves.

Conversation modeling will notably benefit fromdomain knowledge since the relationships between sentences can be clarified dueto semantic hints introduced by knowledge. In this paper, a deep neural networkis proposed to incorporate background knowledge for conversation modeling.Through a specially designed Recall gate, domain knowledge can be transformedinto the extra global memory of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), so as to enhanceLSTM by cooperating with its local memory to capture the implicit semanticrelevance between sentences within conversations. In addition, this paperintroduces the loose structured domain knowledge base, which can be built withslight amount of manual work and easily adopted by the Recall gate. Our modelis evaluated on the context-oriented response selecting task, and experimentalresults on both two datasets have shown that our approach is promising formodeling human conversations and building key components of automatic chattingsystems.

However, it has been shown that humanoperators perform poorly at detecting events found in video footage whenpresented with simultaneous feeds. We utilize computer vision techniques todevelop an automated method of violence detection that can aid a humanoperator. We observed that violence in city centre environments often occur incrowded areas, resulting in individual actions being occluded by other crowdmembers. Measures of visual texture have shown to be effective at encodingcrowd appearance. Therefore, we propose modelling crowd dynamics using changesin crowd texture. We refer to this approach as Violent Crowd Texture (VCT).Real-world surveillance footage of night time environments and the violentflows dataset were tested using a random forest classifier to evaluate theability of the VCT method at discriminating between violent and non-violentbehaviour.

Although many works in the field of natural languageprocessing (NLP) have demonstrated the importance of hashtag recommendation,hashtag recommendation for images has barely been studied. In this paper, weintroduce the HARRISON dataset, a benchmark on hashtag recommendation for realworld images in social networks. The HARRISON dataset is a realistic dataset,composed of 57,383 photos from Instagram and an average of 4.5 associatedhashtags for each photo. To evaluate our dataset, we design a baselineframework consisting of visual feature extractor based on convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) and multi-label classifier based on neural network. Based on thisframework, two single feature-based models, object-based and scene-based model,and an integrated model of them are evaluated on the HARRISON dataset.

As far as we know, thiswork is the first vision-only attempt at hashtag recommendation for real worldimages in social networks. We expect this benchmark to accelerate theadvancement of hashtag recommendation.

Existingmethods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. Thekey to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for aninput hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end systemcalled DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazyimage as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequentlyused to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNetadopts Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based deep architecture, whoselayers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors inimage dehazing. Specifically, layers of Maxout units are used for featureextraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features. We alsopropose a novel nonlinear activation function in DehazeNet, called BilateralRectified Linear Unit (BReLU), which is able to improve the quality ofrecovered haze-free image. We establish connections between components of theproposed DehazeNet and those used in existing methods. Experiments on benchmarkimages show that DehazeNet achieves superior performance over existing methods,yet keeps efficient and easy to use.

Empirical evidence on both problems shows that our approach issignificantly faster than its batch counterparts while achieving comparable orbetter classification performance when classes are unbalanced.

This poor quality may significantly degrade theperformance of many computer vision and multimedia algorithms that areprimarily designed for high-quality inputs. In this paper, we propose a verysimple and effective method, named as LIME, to enhance low-light images. Moreconcretely, the illumination of each pixel is first estimated individually byfinding the maximum value in R, G and B channels (Max-RGB). Further, we refinethe initial illumination map by imposing a structure prior on it, as the finalillumination map. Having the well-constructed illumination map, the enhancementcan be achieved accordingly. Experiments on a number of challenging real-worldlow-light images are present to reveal the efficacy of our LIME and show itssuperiority over several state-of-the-arts.

With casual cameramotions, variable taken views, large depth change, or complex structures, it isa challenging task for stitching these images. The global transformation modeloften provides dreadful stitching results, such as misalignments or projectivedistortions, especially perspective distortion. To this end, we suggest aperspective-preserving warping for image stitching, which spatially combineslocal projective transformations and similarity transformation. By weightedcombination scheme, our approach gradually extrapolates the local projectivetransformations of the overlapping regions into the non-overlapping regions,and thus the final warping can smoothly change from projective to similarity.The proposed method can provide satisfactory alignment accuracy as well asreduce the projective distortions and maintain the multi-perspective view.Experiments on a variety of challenging images confirm the efficiency of theapproach.
arxiv-18300-196 | Relation Schema Induction using Tensor Factorization with Side Information | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04227v2.pdf | author:Madhav Nimishakavi, Uday Singh Saini, Partha Talukdar category:cs.IR cs.CL cs.DB published:2016-05-12 summary:Given a set of documents from a specific domain (e.g., medical researchjournals), how do we automatically identify the schema of relations i.e., typesignature of arguments of relations (e.g., undergo (Patient, Surgery)) - anecessary first step towards building a Knowledge Graph (KG) out of the givenset of documents? We refer to this problem as Relation Schema Induction (RSI).While Open Information Extraction (OIE) techniques aim at extracting surfacelevel triples of the form (John, underwent, Angioplasty), they don't induce theyet unknown schema of relations themselves. Tensors provide a naturalrepresentation for such triples, and factorization of such tensors provide aplausible solution for the RSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, tensorfactorization methods have not been used for the RSI problem. We fill this gapand propose Coupled Non-negative Tensor Factorization (CNTF), a tensorfactorization method which is able to incorporate additional side informationin a principled way for more effective Relation Schema Induction. We report ourfindings on multiple real-world datasets and demonstrate CNTF's effectivenessover state-of-the-art baselines both in terms of accuracy and speed.

However, synthesis dictionary learning typically involves NP-hardsparse coding and expensive learning steps. Recently, sparsifying transformlearning received interest for its cheap computation and its optimal updates inthe alternating algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for learningof Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transforms, dubbed FRIST, tobetter represent natural images that contain textures with various geometricaldirections. The proposed alternating learning algorithm involves efficientoptimal updates. We provide a convergence guarantee, and demonstrate theempirical convergence behavior of the proposed FRIST learning algorithm.Preliminary experiments show the usefulness of adaptive sparse representationby FRIST for image sparse representation, segmentation, denoising, robustinpainting, and MRI reconstruction with promising performances.
arxiv-18300-198 | Locally Weighted Ensemble Clustering | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05011v1.pdf | author:Dong Huang, Chang-Dong Wang, Jian-Huang Lai category:cs.LG published:2016-05-17 summary:Due to its ability to combine multiple base clusterings into a probablybetter and more robust clustering, the ensemble clustering technique has beenattracting increasing attention in recent years. Despite the significantsuccess, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods isthat they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of theirreliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings.Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the baseclusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as anindividual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same baseclustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability ofclusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance theconsensus performance, without access to data features or specific assumptionson data distribution. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novelensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven cluster uncertaintyestimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the uncertainty of eachcluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in the entire ensemblevia an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure isintroduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is presented to serveas a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the local diversity inensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are further proposed.Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate thesuperiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.

Boult category:cs.CV published:2016-05-05 summary:State-of-the-art deep neural networks suffer from a fundamental problem -they misclassify adversarial examples formed by applying small perturbations toinputs. In this paper, we present a new psychometric perceptual adversarialsimilarity score (PASS) measure for quantifying adversarial images, introducethe notion of hard positive generation, and use a diverse set of adversarialperturbations - not just the closest ones - for data augmentation. We introducea novel hot/cold approach for adversarial example generation, which providesmultiple possible adversarial perturbations for every single image. Theperturbations generated by our novel approach often correspond to semanticallymeaningful image structures, and allow greater flexibility to scaleperturbation-amplitudes, which yields an increased diversity of adversarialimages. We present adversarial images on several network topologies anddatasets, including LeNet on the MNIST dataset, and GoogLeNet and ResidualNeton the ImageNet dataset. Finally, we demonstrate on LeNet and GoogLeNet thatfine-tuning with a diverse set of hard positives improves the robustness ofthese networks compared to training with prior methods of generatingadversarial images.

However, a large set of annotateddata might be unavailable or extremely labor intensive. In this paper, weinvestigate the usage of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to obtain competitivedetection accuracy with very limited training data (three labeled images).Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised structured ensemble learningapproach for contour detection built on structured random forests (SRF). Toallow SRF to be applicable to unlabeled data, we present an effective sparserepresentation approach to capture inherent structure in image patches byfinding a compact and discriminative low-dimensional subspace representation inan unsupervised manner, enabling the incorporation of abundant unlabeledpatches with their estimated structured labels to help SRF perform better nodesplitting. We re-examine the role of sparsity and propose a novel and fastsparse coding algorithm to boost the overall learning efficiency. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply SSL for contour detection.Extensive experiments on the BSDS500 segmentation dataset and the NYU Depthdataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

It is shownthat for any constant factor $\beta > 1$, selecting $\beta k$ cluster centersby $D^\ell$ sampling yields a constant-factor approximation to the optimalclustering with $k$ centers, in expectation and without conditions on thedataset. This result extends the previously known $O(\log k)$ guarantee for thecase $\beta = 1$ to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime. It also improvesupon an existing constant-factor bi-criteria result that holds only withconstant probability.

However,finding the best strategy that maximizes result accuracy is non-trivial, as itinvolves solving a complex constrained optimization program that appears to benon-linear and non-convex. Hence, in the past much effort has been devoted insolving this non-convex optimization program. Existing approaches includevarious sophisticated heuristics and expensive numerical solutions. None ofthem, however, guarantees to find the optimal solution of this optimizationproblem. This paper points out that under ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy,the optimal solution of the above constrained optimization problem in search ofa suitable strategy can be found, rather surprisingly, by solving a simple andelegant convex optimization program. Then, we propose an efficient algorithmbased on Newton's method, which we prove to always converge to the optimalsolution with linear global convergence rate and quadratic local convergencerate. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of theproposed solution.

Kim, Washington Mio category:stat.ML 62-07, 92C50 published:2016-05-16 summary:Many complex ecosystems, such as those formed by multiple microbial taxa,involve intricate interactions amongst various sub-communities. The most basicrelationships are frequently modeled as co-occurrence networks in which thenodes represent the various players in the community and the weighted edgesencode levels of interaction. In this setting, the composition of a communitymay be viewed as a probability distribution on the nodes of the network. Thispaper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data, as well astheir Euclidean counterparts, across spatial scales. Using the notion ofdiffusion distance, we introduce diffusion Fr\'echet functions and diffusionFr\'echet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean spacesand the vertex set of a weighted network, respectively. We prove that thesefunctional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distancebetween probability measures, thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes.We apply the methodology to investigate bacterial communities in the human gut,seeking to characterize divergence from intestinal homeostasis in patients withClostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effects of fecal microbiotatransplantation, a treatment used in CDI patients that has proven to besignificantly more effective than traditional treatment with antibiotics. Theproposed method proves useful in deriving a biomarker that might help elucidatethe mechanisms that drive these processes.

West, Bill Howe category:cs.SI cs.CV cs.DL cs.IR published:2016-05-16 summary:Scientific results are communicated visually in the literature throughdiagrams, visualizations, and photographs. These information-dense objects havebeen largely ignored in bibliometrics and scientometrics studies when comparedto citations and text. In this paper, we use techniques from computer visionand machine learning to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5figure types and study the resulting patterns of visual information as theyrelate to impact. We find that the distribution of figures and figure types inthe literature has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widelyacross field and topic. Remarkably, we find a significant correlation betweenscientific impact and the use of visual information, where higher impact paperstend to include more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots andphotographs. To explore these results and other ways of extracting this visualinformation, we have built a visual browser to illustrate the concept andexplore design alternatives for supporting viziometric analysis and organizingvisual information. We use these results to articulate a new research agenda --viziometrics -- to study the organization and presentation of visualinformation in the scientific literature.

Sveinsson category:cs.CV stat.ML published:2016-05-16 summary:Big data applications, such as medical imaging and genetics, typicallygenerate datasets that consist of few observations n on many more variables p,a scenario that we denote as p>>n. Traditional data processing methods areoften insufficient for extracting information out of big data. This calls forthe development of new algorithms that can deal with the size, complexity, andthe special structure of such datasets. In this paper, we consider the problemof classifying p>>n data and propose a classification method based on lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA). Traditional LDA depends on the covariance estimateof the data, but when p>>n the sample covariance estimate is singular. Theproposed method estimates the covariance by using a sparse version of noisyprincipal component analysis (nPCA). The use of sparsity in this setting aimsat automatically selecting variables that are relevant for classification. Inexperiments, the new method is compared to state-of-the art methods for bigdata problems using both simulated datasets and imaging genetics datasets.

To deal with the large label size problem, recent works proposesketch-based methods to approximate the distribution on labels per node therebyachieving a space reduction from $O(m)$ to $O(\log m)$, under certainconditions. In this paper, we present a novel streaming graph-based SSLapproximation that captures the sparsity of the label distribution and ensuresthe algorithm propagates labels accurately, and further reduces the spacecomplexity per node to $O(1)$. We also provide a distributed version of thealgorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-worlddatasets demonstrate that the new method achieves better performance thanexisting state-of-the-art algorithms with significant reduction in memoryfootprint. We also study different graph construction mechanisms for naturallanguage applications and propose a robust graph augmentation strategy trainedusing state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning architectures that yieldsfurther significant quality gains.

In this work, we describe an approachfor training a discriminative model, namely a neural network, in order toapproximate the optimal proposal by using posterior estimates from previousruns of inference. We show an example that incorporates a data-driven proposalfor use in a non-parametric model in the Anglican probabilistic programmingsystem. Our results show that data-driven proposals can significantly improveinference performance so that considerably fewer particles are necessary toperform a good posterior estimation.

Recent research shows that there is considerable redundancy in theparameter space of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method tocompress deep neural networks by using the Fisher Information metric, which weestimate through a stochastic optimization method that keeps track ofsecond-order information in the network. We first remove unimportant parametersand then use non-uniform fixed point quantization to assign more bits toparameters with higher Fisher Information estimates. We evaluate our method ona classification task with a convolutional neural network trained on the MNISTdata set. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existingmethods for both network pruning and quantization.

GIFs are short looping video with no sound, and a perfect combinationbetween image and video that really capture our attention. GIFs tell a story,express emotion, turn events into humorous moments, and are the new wave ofphotojournalism. We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual andelaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generatedGIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates aranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train ourmodel to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectivelydeal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in theranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picksup several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs. Onour new large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the advantage of our approachover several state-of-the-art methods.

However, allowing user participation alsoinvites undesirable behavior such as trolling. In this paper, we characterizeantisocial behavior in three large online discussion communities by analyzingusers who were banned from these communities. We find that such users tend toconcentrate their efforts in a small number of threads, are more likely to postirrelevantly, and are more successful at garnering responses from other users.Studying the evolution of these users from the moment they join a community upto when they get banned, we find that not only do they write worse than otherusers over time, but they also become increasingly less tolerated by thecommunity. Further, we discover that antisocial behavior is exacerbated whencommunity feedback is overly harsh. Our analysis also reveals distinct groupsof users with different levels of antisocial behavior that can change overtime. We use these insights to identify antisocial users early on, a task ofhigh practical importance to community maintainers.

However, these vector space representations (created throughlarge-scale text analysis) are typically stored verbatim, since their internalstructure is opaque. Using word-analogy tests to monitor the level of detailstored in compressed re-representations of the same vector space, thetrade-offs between the reduction in memory usage and expressiveness areinvestigated. A simple scheme is outlined that can reduce the memory footprintof a state-of-the-art embedding by a factor of 10, with only minimal impact onperformance. Then, using the same `bit budget', a binary (approximate)factorisation of the same space is also explored, with the aim of creating anequivalent representation with better interpretability.

The proposed algorithm incorporates a new strategy of searching theproblem space by dividing the swarm into subswarms. Each subswarm particlessearch for better solution separately lead to better exploitation while theycooperate with each other to find the best global position. The consequence ofthe aforementioned cooperation is better exploration, convergence and it ablethe algorithm to jump from local optimal solution to the better spots. Apractical application of this method is demonstrated for the problem of medicalimage thresholding segmentation. We considered two classical thresholdingtechniques of Otsu and Kapur separately as the objective function for theoptimization method and applied on a set of brain MR images. Comparativeexperimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms another stateof the art method from the literature in terms of accuracy, computation timeand stable results.

We propose a novelconcept for anomaly detection, called relative anomaly detection. It istailored to be robust towards anomalies that occur frequently, by taking intoaccount their location relative to the most typical observations. Theapproaches we develop are computationally feasible even for large data sets,and they allow real-time detection. We illustrate using data sets of potentialscraping attempts and Wi-Fi channel utilization, both from Google, Inc.

Naturally, the patch-size has a major impact on thematching quality, and on the consequent application performance. Under theassumption that our patch database is sufficiently sampled, using large patches(e.g. 21-by-21) should be preferred over small ones (e.g. 7-by-7). However,this "dense-sampling" assumption is rarely true; in most cases large patchescannot find relevant nearby examples. This phenomenon is a consequence of thecurse of dimensionality, stating that the database-size should growexponentially with the patch-size to ensure proper matches. This explains thefavored choice of small patch-size in most applications. Is there a way to keep the simplicity and work with small patches whilegetting some of the benefits that large patches provide? In this work we offersuch an approach. We propose to concatenate the regular content of aconventional (small) patch with a compact representation of its (large)surroundings - its context. Therefore, with a minor increase of the dimensions(e.g. with additional 10 values to the patch representation), weimplicitly/softly describe the information of a large patch. The additionaldescriptors are computed based on a self-similarity behavior of the patchsurrounding. We show that this approach achieves better matches, compared to the use ofconventional-size patches, without the need to increase the database-size.Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on three distinctproblems: (i) External natural image denoising, (ii) Depth imagesuper-resolution, and (iii) Motion-compensated frame-rate up-conversion.

As a novel branch of visual saliency, co-saliencydetection refers to discovery of the common and salient foregrounds existed intwo or more relevant images, and can be more widely used in many computervision tasks. The existing co-saliency detection algorithms mainly consist ofthree components: extracting effective features to represent the image regions,exploring the informative cues or factors to characterize co-saliency, anddesigning effective computational framework to formulate co-saliency. Althoughenormous methods have been developed, a deep review of the literaturesconcerning about the co-saliency detection technique is still lacking. In thispaper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the fundamentals,challenges, and applications in co-saliency detection area. Specifically, thispaper provides the overview of some related computer vision works, reviews thehistory of co-saliency detection briefly, summarizes and categorizes the majoralgorithms in this research area, presents the potential applications ofco-saliency detection, discusses some open issues in this research area, andfinally points out some unsolved challenges and promising future works. It isour hope that this review will be beneficial for both the fresh and seniorresearchers in this field as well as researchers working in other relevantfields to have a better understanding about what they can do with co-saliencydetection in the future.

We propose an approach based onKernel Canonical Correlation Analysis, which builds a latent semantic spacewhere correlation of visual and textual features are well preserved into asemantic embedding. Images in the semantic space have reduced semantic gap andthus they are likely to give better annotation performance. The proposedapproach is robust and can work either when the training set is well annotatedby experts, as well as when it is noisy such as in the case of user-generatedtags in social media. We evaluate our framework on four popular datasets. Ourresults show that our KCCA-based approach can be applied to severalstate-of-the-art label transfer methods to obtain significant improvements. Inparticular, nearest neighbor methods for label transfer get the most benefitand enable our approach to scale on never seen labels at training time. Ourapproach works even with the noisy tags of social users, provided thatappropriate denoising is performed. Experiments on a large scale setting showthat our method can provide some benefits even when the semantic space isestimated on a subset of training images.

Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer toas string Gaussian processes (string GPs), which are not to be mistaken forGaussian processes operating on text. We construct string GPs so that theirfinite-dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independencestructures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametricBayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuringsome mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priorsnaturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learnedlatent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, weprovide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GPparadigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes,which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, wederive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasksunder string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational timecomplexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and memory requirement $\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $N$is the data size and $d$ the dimension of the input space. We illustrate theefficacy of the proposed approach on several synthetic and real-world datasets,including a dataset with $6$ millions input points and $8$ attributes.

The Bayesian solution to this problem is known as aBayes filter, and previous work has shown how to exactly implement a Bayesfilter in a theoretical neural circuit when the stimulus dynamics are known andlinear. In this paper we develop a method for approximating a Bayes filter whenthe stimulus dynamics are unknown and nonlinear, by training a recurrent neuralnetwork to approximate the predictions of the Bayes filter. To train thenetwork, we use a combination of contrastive divergence minimization andbackpropagation, in order to maximize the likelihood of the parameters of thenetwork given the population responses. We demonstrate this method on a problemwhere the stimulus is a stochastic pendulum, and show how the learned networkdisplays many of the characteristic properties found in research on populationsof neurons.

The L2 distance between the full (float or double)precision weights and the ternary weights along with a scaling factor isminimized. With the optimization, the TWNs own high capacity of modelexpression that is good enough to approximate the Full Precision WeightNetworks (FPWNs) counterpart. Besides, the TWNs achieve up to 16x or 32x modelcompression rate and own much fewer multiplications compared with the FPWNs.Compared with recently proposed Binary Precision Weight Networks (BPWNs), theTWNs own nearly 38x more power of expression in a 3$\times$3 size filter, whichis commonly used in most of the state-of-the-art CNN models like residualnetworks or VGG. Besides, the TWNs eliminate the singularity at zero andconverge faster and more stablely at training time. Benchmarks on MNIST,CIFAR-10, and the large scale ImageNet dataset show that TWNs achievestate-of-the-art performance which is only slightly worse than the FPWNscounterpart but outperforms the analogous BPWNs.
arxiv-18300-227 | Estimation of Fiber Orientations Using Neighborhood Information | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04115v2.pdf | author:Chuyang Ye, Jiachen Zhuo, Rao P. Gullapalli, Jerry L. Prince category:cs.CV published:2016-01-16 summary:Data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can be used toreconstruct fiber tracts, for example, in muscle and white matter. Estimationof fiber orientations (FOs) is a crucial step in the reconstruction process andthese estimates can be corrupted by noise. In this paper, a new method calledFiber Orientation Reconstruction using Neighborhood Information (FORNI) isdescribed and shown to reduce the effects of noise and improve FO estimationperformance by incorporating spatial consistency. FORNI uses a fixed tensorbasis to model the diffusion weighted signals, which has the advantage ofproviding an explicit relationship between the basis vectors and the FOs. FOspatial coherence is encouraged using weighted l1-norm regularization terms,which contain the interaction of directional information between neighborvoxels. Data fidelity is encouraged using a squared error between the observedand reconstructed diffusion weighted signals. After appropriate weighting ofthese competing objectives, the resulting objective function is minimized usinga block coordinate descent algorithm, and a straightforward parallelizationstrategy is used to speed up processing. Experiments were performed on adigital crossing phantom, ex vivo tongue dMRI data, and in vivo brain dMRI datafor both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The results demonstrate thatFORNI improves the quality of FO estimation over other state of the artalgorithms.

Over the years anumber of machine learning researchers have presented various models forpredicting the presence of missing relations in a knowledge base. Although allthe previous methods are presented with empirical results that show highperformance on select datasets, there is almost no previous work onunderstanding the connection between properties of a knowledge base and theperformance of a model. In this paper we analyze the RESCAL method and provethat it can not encode asymmetric transitive relations in knowledge bases.

However, it is typically unknown in practiceand has remained a challenge when nothing about the size of the support isknown. As pointed recently, $\x\_0$ might not be the best metric to minimizedirectly, both due to its inherent complexity as well as its noise performance.Recently a novel stable measure of sparsity $s(\mathbf{x}) :=\\mathbf{x}\_1^2/\\mathbf{x}\_2^2$ has been investigated by Lopes\cite{Lopes2012}, which is a sharp lower bound on $\\mathbf{x}\_0$. Theestimation procedure for this measure uses only a small number of linearmeasurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires verylittle computation. The usage of the quantity $s(\mathbf{x})$ in sparse signalestimation problems has not received much importance yet. We develop the ideaof incorporating $s(\mathbf{x})$ into the signal estimation framework. We alsoprovide a three step algorithm to solve problems of the form $\mathbf{Ax=b}$with no additional assumptions on the original signal $\mathbf{x}$.

We compare several variants of neural networks for sentence embeddings in asetting of decision-making based on evidence of varying relevance. We propose abasic model to integrate evidence for entailment, show that joint training ofthe sentence embeddings to model relevance and entailment is feasible even withno explicit per-evidence supervision, and show the importance of evaluatingstrong baselines. We also demonstrate the benefit of carrying over textcomprehension model trained on an unrelated task for our small datasets. Our research is motivated primarily by a new open dataset we introduce,consisting of binary questions and news-based evidence snippets. We also applythe proposed relevance-entailment model on a similar task of rankingmultiple-choice test answers, evaluating it on a preliminary dataset of schooltest questions as well as the standard MCTest dataset, where we improve theneural model state-of-art.

Molecular energies areinvariant to isometric atomic displacements, and are Lipschitz continuous tomolecular deformations. Similarly to density functional theory (DFT), themolecule is represented by an electronic density function. A multiscaleinvariant dictionary is calculated with wavelet scattering invariants. Itcascades a first wavelet transform which separates scales, with a secondwavelet transform which computes interactions across scales. Sparse scatteringregressions give state of the art results over two databases of organic planarmolecules. On these databases, the regression error is of the order of theerror produced by DFT codes, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

A popular way of performing the above task, oftendubbed quantification, is to use supervised learning to train a prevalenceestimator from labelled data. In this paper we propose the first onlinestochastic algorithms for directly optimizing (i) performance measures forquantification, and (ii) hybrid performance measures that seek to balancequantification and classification performance. We prove rigorous bounds for ouralgorithms which demonstrate that they exhibit optimal convergence. Ouralgorithms present a significant advancement in the theory of multivariateoptimization. We also report extensive experiments on benchmark and real datasets which demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existingoptimization techniques used for the quantification problem.

This method requiresderivatives of objective functions and has some difficulties findingappropriate parameters such as learning rate. In this paper, we propose a novelapproach for computing weight matrices of fully-connected DNNs by using twotypes of semi-nonnegative matrix factorizations (semi-NMFs). In this method,optimization processes are performed by calculating weight matricesalternately, and backpropagation (BP) is not used. We also present a method tocalculate stacked autoencoder using a NMF. The output results of theautoencoder are used as pre-training data for DNNs. The experimental resultsshow that our method using three types of NMFs attains similar error rates tothe conventional DNNs with BP.

By assuming that the clairvoyant moves slowly(i.e., the minimizers change slowly), we present several improvedvariation-based upper bounds of the dynamic regret under the true and noisygradient feedback, which are {\it optimal} in light of the presented lowerbounds. The key to our analysis is to explore a regularity metric that measuresthe temporal changes in the clairvoyant's minimizers, to which we refer as {\itpath variation}. Firstly, we present a general lower bound in terms of the pathvariation, and then show that under full information or gradient feedback weare able to achieve an optimal dynamic regret. Secondly, we present a lowerbound with noisy gradient feedback and then show that we can achieve optimaldynamic regrets under a stochastic gradient feedback and two-point banditfeedback. Moreover, for a sequence of smooth loss functions that admit a smallvariation in the gradients, our dynamic regret under the two-point banditfeedback matches what is achieved with full information.

The goal of this approach is to learn a personalizedheartbeat "concept" for an individual. This heartbeat concept is a prototype(or "signature") that characterizes the heartbeat pattern for an individual inballistocardiogram data. The $e$FUMI method models the problem of learning aheartbeat concept from a BCG signal as a MIL problem. This approach elegantlyaddresses the uncertainty inherent in a BCG signal e. g., misalignment betweentraining data and ground truth, mis-collection of heartbeat by sometransducers, etc. Given a BCG training signal coupled with a ground truthsignal (e.g., a pulse finger sensor), training "bags" labeled with only binarylabels denoting if a training bag contains a heartbeat signal or not can begenerated. Then, using these bags, $e$FUMI learns a personalized concept ofheartbeat for a subject as well as several non-heartbeat background concepts.After learning the heartbeat concept, heartbeat detection and heart rateestimation can be applied to test data. Experimental results show that theestimated heartbeat concept found by $e$FUMI is more representative and a morediscriminative prototype of the heartbeat signals than those found bycomparison MIL methods in the literature.

We show how the parameters of a function that has beenfit to the video data can serve as a robust new video representation. As aspecific example, we learn a pooling function via ranking machines. By learningto rank the frame-level features of a video in chronological order, we obtain anew representation that captures the video-wide temporal dynamics of a video,suitable for action recognition. Other than ranking functions, we exploredifferent parametric models that could also explain the temporal changes invideos. The proposed functional pooling methods, and rank pooling inparticular, is easy to interpret and implement, fast to compute and effectivein recognizing a wide variety of actions. We evaluate our method on variousbenchmarks for generic action, fine-grained action and gesture recognition.Results show that rank pooling brings an absolute improvement of 7-10 averagepooling baseline. At the same time, rank pooling is compatible with andcomplementary to several appearance and local motion based methods andfeatures, such as improved trajectories and deep learning features.

However, high performancehardware is typically indispensable for the application of CNN models due tothe high computation complexity, which prohibits their further extensions. Inthis paper, we propose an efficient framework, namely Quantized CNN, tosimultaneously speed-up the computation and reduce the storage and memoryoverhead of CNN models. Both filter kernels in convolutional layers andweighting matrices in fully-connected layers are quantized, aiming atminimizing the estimation error of each layer's response. Extensive experimentson the ILSVRC-12 benchmark demonstrate 4~6x speed-up and 15~20x compressionwith merely one percentage loss of classification accuracy. With our quantizedCNN model, even mobile devices can accurately classify images within onesecond.

Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and MatthiasBethge, arXiv:1508.06576). While showing great results when transferring homogeneous and repetitivepatterns, the original style representation often fails to capture more complexproperties, like having separate styles of foreground and background. Thisleads to visual artifacts and undesirable textures appearing in unexpectedregions when performing style transfer. We tackle this issue with a variety of approaches, mostly by modifying thestyle representation in order for it to capture more information and impose atighter constraint on the style transfer result. In our experiments, we subjectively evaluate our best method as producingfrom barely noticeable to significant improvements in the quality of styletransfer.

Therefore, modern flight management systems arereliant on multiple redundant sensors to monitor and control the rotations ofthe aircraft. To this end, a novel distributed quaternion Kalman filteringalgorithm is developed for tracking the rotation and orientation of an aircraftin the three-dimensional space. The algorithm is developed to distributecomputation among the sensors in a manner that forces them to consent to aunique solution while being robust to sensor and link failure, a desirablecharacteristic for flight management systems. In addition, the underlyingquaternion-valued state space model allows to avoid problems associated withgimbal lock. The performance of the developed algorithm is verified throughsimulations.

The objective function that we wish to minimize is thesum of a convex differentiable data-fidelity (negative log-likelihood (NLL))term and a convex regularization term. We apply sparse signal regularizationwhere the signal belongs to a closed convex set within the closure of thedomain of the NLL; the convex-set constraint facilitates flexible NLL domainsand accurate signal recovery. Signal sparsity is imposed using the$\ell_1$-norm penalty on the signal's linear transform coefficients or gradientmap, respectively. The PNPG approach employs projected Nesterov's accelerationstep with restart and an inner iteration to compute the proximal mapping. Wepropose an adaptive step-size selection scheme to obtain a good localmajorizing function of the NLL and reduce the time spent backtracking. Thanksto step-size adaptation, PNPG does not require Lipschitz continuity of thegradient of the NLL. We present an integrated derivation of the momentumacceleration and its $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ convergence-rate and iterateconvergence proofs, which account for adaptive step-size selection, inexactnessof the iterative proximal mapping, and the convex-set constraint. The tuning ofPNPG is largely application-independent. Tomographic and compressed-sensingreconstruction experiments with Poisson generalized linear and Gaussian linearmeasurement models demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Jacobs category:cs.CV published:2015-07-28 summary:Understanding how an animal can deform and articulate is essential for arealistic modification of its 3D model. In this paper, we show that suchinformation can be learned from user-clicked 2D images and a template 3D modelof the target animal. We present a volumetric deformation framework thatproduces a set of new 3D models by deforming a template 3D model according to aset of user-clicked images. Our framework is based on a novel locally-boundeddeformation energy, where every local region has its own stiffness value thatbounds how much distortion is allowed at that location. We jointly learn thelocal stiffness bounds as we deform the template 3D mesh to match eachuser-clicked image. We show that this seemingly complex task can be solved as asequence of convex optimization problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofour approach on cats and horses, which are highly deformable and articulatedanimals. Our framework produces new 3D models of animals that are significantlymore plausible than methods without learned stiffness.

Our method is based on theinitial assignment of confidence values, which measure the affinity between anew test point and each known class. We first compare the values of the two topelements in this vector of confidence values. In the heart of our method liesthe training of an ensemble of classifiers, each trained to discriminate knownfrom novel classes based on some partition of the training data intopresumed-known and presumednovel classes. Our final novelty score is derivedfrom the output of this ensemble of classifiers. We evaluated our method on twodatasets of images containing a relatively large number of classes - theCaltech-256 and Cifar-100 datasets. We compared our method to 3 alternativemethods which represent commonly used approaches, including the one-class SVM,novelty based on k-NN, novelty based on maximal confidence, and the recentKNFST method. The results show a very clear and marked advantage for our methodover all alternative methods, in an experimental setup where class labels aremissing during training.

Features learned in the hidden layers ofdeep neural networks trained in computer vision tasks have been shown to besimilar to mid-level vision features.

The proposedregularization technique enforces smoothness of the features learned by hiddennodes and turns out to be a special case of Tikhonov regularization. We achievehigher classification accuracy as compared to existing regularizers such as theL2 norm regularizer and dropout, on benchmark datasets with no change in thetraining computational complexity.

The similarity datasets that come from the twofields differ in design: psychological datasets are focused around a certaintopic such as fruit names; linguistic datasets contain words from variouscategories. The later makes humans assign low similarity scores to the wordsthat have nothing in common and to the words that have contrast in meaning,making similarity scores ambiguous. In this work we discuss the similaritycollection procedure for a multi-category dataset that avoids score ambiguityand suggest changes to the evaluation procedure to reflect the insights ofpsychological literature for word, phrase and sentence similarity. We suggestto ask humans to provide a list of commonalities and differences instead ofnumerical similarity scores and employ the structure of human judgements beyondpairwise similarity. We believe that the proposed approach will give rise todatasets that test meaning representation models more thoroughly with respectto the human treatment of similarity.

Specifically, thesemodels have been used to eliminate or down-weight background pixels that arenot important for the task at hand. In order to deal with this problem, wepropose an attentional model that learns where to look in a video directly fromhuman fixation data. The proposed model leverages deep 3D convolutionalfeatures to represent clip segments in videos. This clip-level representationis aggregated over time by a long short-term memory network that connects intoa mixture density network model of the likely positions of fixations in eachframe. The resulting model is trained end to end using backpropagation. Ourexperiments show state-of-the-art performance on saliency prediction forvideos. Experiments on Hollywood2 and UCF101 also show that the saliency can beused to improve classification accuracy on action recognition tasks.

In three views, a similar role isassigned to the calibrated trifocal tensor. It is a particular case of the(uncalibrated) trifocal tensor and thus it inherits all its properties but, dueto the smaller degrees of freedom, satisfies a number of additional algebraicconstraints. Some of them are described in this paper. More specifically, wedefine a new notion --- the trifocal essential matrix. On the one hand, it is ageneralization of the ordinary (bifocal) essential matrix, and, on the otherhand, it is closely related to the calibrated trifocal tensor. We prove the twonecessary and sufficient conditions that characterize the set of trifocalessential matrices. Based on these characterizations, we propose threenecessary conditions on a calibrated trifocal tensor. They have a form of 15quartic and 99 quintic polynomial equations. We show that in the practicallysignificant real case the 15 quartic constraints are also sufficient.

Our proposedmethod jointly learns the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporallyconstrained metrics. In our method, a siamese convolutional neural network(CNN) is first pre-trained on the auxiliary data. Then the siamese CNN andtemporally constrained metrics are jointly learned online to construct theappearance-based tracklet affinity models. The proposed method can jointlylearn the hierarchical deep features and temporally constrained segment-wisemetrics under a unified framework. For reliable association between tracklets,a novel loss function incorporating temporally constrained multi-task learningmechanism is proposed. By employing the proposed method, tracklet associationcan be accomplished even in challenging situations. Moreover, a large-scaledataset with 40 fully annotated sequences is created to facilitate the trackingevaluation. Experimental results on five public datasets and the newlarge-scale dataset show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-artapproaches in multi-object tracking.

Anchoring is a well known cognitive bias in humandecision making, where judgments are drawn towards pre-existing values. Westudy the influence of anchoring on a standard approach to creation ofsyntactic resources where syntactic annotations are obtained via human editingof tagger and parser output. Our experiments demonstrate a clear anchoringeffect and reveal unwanted consequences, including overestimation of parsingperformance and lower quality of annotations in comparison with human-basedannotations. Using sentences from the Penn Treebank WSJ, we also report thefirst systematically obtained inter-annotator agreement estimates for Englishsyntactic parsing. Our agreement results control for anchoring bias, and areconsequential in that they are \emph{on par} with state of the art parsingperformance for English. We discuss the impact of our findings on strategiesfor future annotation efforts and parser evaluations.

Tizhoosh, Ershad Banijamali category:cs.CV published:2016-05-14 summary:In recent years, advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence ofmassive databases, containing images from a diverse range of modalities. Thishas significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images onone side, and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systemson the other side. Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as apotential vehicle to achieve these goals. One of the recently introduced binarydescriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes (RBCs) that aredriven from Radon transform via local thresholding. Gabor transform is also apowerful transform to extract texture-based information. Gabor features haveexhibited robustness against rotation, scale, and also photometricdisturbances, such as illumination changes and image noise in manyapplications. This paper introduces Gabor Barcodes (GBCs), as a novel frameworkfor the image annotation. To find the most discriminative GBC for a given queryimage, the effects of employing Gabor filters with different parameters, i.e.,different sets of scales and orientations, are investigated, resulting indifferent barcode lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method hasbeen evaluated on the IRMA dataset with 193 classes comprising of 12,677 x-rayimages for indexing, and 1,733 x-rays images for testing. A total error scoreas low as $351$ ($\approx 80\%$ accuracy for the first hit) was achieved.
arxiv-18300-254 | Capturing divergence in dependency trees to improve syntactic projection | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04475v1.pdf | author:Ryan Georgi, Fei Xia, William D. Lewis category:cs.CL published:2016-05-14 summary:Obtaining syntactic parses is a crucial part of many NLP pipelines. However,most of the world's languages do not have large amounts of syntacticallyannotated corpora available for building parsers. Syntactic projectiontechniques attempt to address this issue by using parallel corpora consistingof resource-poor and resource-rich language pairs, taking advantage of a parserfor the resource-rich language and word alignment between the languages toproject the parses onto the data for the resource-poor language. Theseprojection methods can suffer, however, when the two languages are divergent.In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using small, parallel,annotated corpora to automatically detect divergent structural patterns betweentwo languages. These patterns can then be used to improve structural projectionalgorithms, allowing for better performing NLP tools for resource-poorlanguages, in particular those that may not have large amounts of annotateddata necessary for traditional, fully-supervised methods. While this detectionprocess is not exhaustive, we demonstrate that common patterns of divergencecan be identified automatically without prior knowledge of a given languagepair, and the patterns can be used to improve performance of projectionalgorithms.

Wallace category:cs.CL published:2016-05-14 summary:We present a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for textclassification that jointly exploits labels on documents and their componentsentences. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which annotators explicitlymark sentences (or snippets) that support their overall documentcategorization, i.e., they provide rationales. Our model uses such supervisionvia a hierarchical approach in which each document is represented by a linearcombination of the vector representations of its constituent sentences. Wepropose a sentence-level convolutional model that estimates the probabilitythat a given sentence is a rationale, and we then scale the contribution ofeach sentence to the aggregate document representation in proportion to theseestimates. Experiments on five classification datasets that have documentlabels and associated rationales demonstrate that our approach consistentlyoutperforms strong baselines. Moreover, our model naturally providesexplanations for its predictions.

Unfortunately, naive modeling with aggregated data maysignificantly diminish the accuracy of inferences at the individual level. Thispaper addresses the scenario where features are provided at the individuallevel, but the target variables are only available as histogram aggregates ororder statistics. We consider a limiting case of generalized linear modelingwhen the target variables are only known up to permutation, and explore howthis relates to permutation testing; a standard technique for assessingstatistical dependency. Based on this relationship, we propose a simplealgorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level inferences viaalternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting. Ourresults suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in theoriginal data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of thelinear relationship. The framework is extended to general histogram data withlarger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Ourexperimental results on simulated data and aggregated healthcare data suggest adiminishing returns property with respect to the granularity of the histogram -when a linear relationship holds in the original data, the targets can bepredicted accurately given relatively coarse histograms.
arxiv-18300-257 | Monotone Retargeting for Unsupervised Rank Aggregation with Object Features | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04465v1.pdf | author:Avradeep Bhowmik, Joydeep Ghosh category:stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG published:2016-05-14 summary:Learning the true ordering between objects by aggregating a set of expertopinion rank order lists is an important and ubiquitous problem in manyapplications ranging from social choice theory to natural language processingand search aggregation. We study the problem of unsupervised rank aggregationwhere no ground truth ordering information in available, neither about the truepreference ordering between any set of objects nor about the quality ofindividual rank lists. Aggregating the often inconsistent and poor quality ranklists in such an unsupervised manner is a highly challenging problem, andstandard consensus-based methods are often ill-defined, and difficult to solve.In this manuscript we propose a novel framework to bypass these issues by usingobject attributes to augment the standard rank aggregation framework. We designalgorithms that learn joint models on both rank lists and object features toobtain an aggregated rank ordering that is more accurate and robust, and alsohelps weed out rank lists of dubious validity. We validate our techniques onsynthetic datasets where our algorithm is able to estimate the true rankordering even when the rank lists are corrupted. Experiments on three realdatasets, MQ2008, MQ2008 and OHSUMED, show that using object features canresult in significant improvement in performance over existing rank aggregationmethods that do not use object information. Furthermore, when at least some ofthe rank lists are of high quality, our methods are able to effectively exploittheir high expertise to output an aggregated rank ordering of great accuracy.

In thispaper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse oftext-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novelcomputational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguisticaspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applyingtechniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language modelcomparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequencyanalyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associatedwith better conversation outcomes.

Langs, M. Grosse-Wentrup, B. Murphy, G. Cecchi category:stat.ML published:2016-05-14 summary:This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on MachineLearning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural InformationProcessing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statisticalmethods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are beingincreasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive statedetection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysismethods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensionalsignals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the categoryof a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mentaldisorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariateapproaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individualimaging measurement in isolation. We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping howquestions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set isnow entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equallyimportant that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidlyevolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, thereis an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context ofrich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specificparadigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring theinteraction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of theworkshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges acrossthe neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and tosketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology.

Bach, Maarten Speekenbrink, Andreas Krause category:stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-02-02 summary:Exploration-exploitation of functions, that is learning and optimizing amapping between inputs and expected outputs, is ubiquitous to many real worldsituations. These situations sometimes require us to avoid certain outcomes atall cost, for example because they are poisonous, harmful, or otherwisedangerous. We test participants' behavior in scenarios in which they have tofind the optimum of a function while at the same time avoid outputs below acertain threshold. In two experiments, we find that Safe-Optimization, aGaussian Process-based exploration-exploitation algorithm, describesparticipants' behavior well and that participants seem to care firstly whethera point is safe and then try to pick the optimal point from all such safepoints. This means that their trade-off between exploration and exploitationcan be seen as an intelligent, approximate, and homeostasis-driven strategy.
arxiv-18300-261 | Online Optimization for Large-Scale Max-Norm Regularization | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3190v4.pdf | author:Jie Shen, Huan Xu, Ping Li category:stat.ML cs.LG published:2014-06-12 summary:Max-norm regularizer has been extensively studied in the last decade as itpromotes an effective low-rank estimation for the underlying data. However,such max-norm regularized problems are typically formulated and solved in abatch manner, which prevents it from processing big data due to possible memorybudget. In this paper, hence, we propose an online algorithm that is scalableto large-scale setting. Particularly, we consider the matrix decompositionproblem as an example, although a simple variant of the algorithm and analysiscan be adapted to other important problems such as matrix completion. Thecrucial technique in our implementation is to reformulating the max-norm to anequivalent matrix factorization form, where the factors consist of a (possiblyovercomplete) basis component and a coefficients one. In this way, we maymaintain the basis component in the memory and optimize over it and thecoefficients for each sample alternatively. Since the memory footprint of thebasis component is independent of the sample size, our algorithm is appealingwhen manipulating a large collection of samples. We prove that the sequence ofthe solutions (i.e., the basis component) produced by our algorithm convergesto a stationary point of the expected loss function asymptotically. Numericalstudy demonstrates encouraging results for the efficacy and robustness of ouralgorithm compared to the widely used nuclear norm solvers.
arxiv-18300-262 | Neural Dataset Generality | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04369v1.pdf | author:Ragav Venkatesan, Vijetha Gattupalli, Baoxin Li category:cs.CV published:2016-05-14 summary:Often the filters learned by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fromdifferent datasets appear similar. This is prominent in the first few layers.This similarity of filters is being exploited for the purposes of transferlearning and some studies have been made to analyse such transferability offeatures. This is also being used as an initialization technique for differenttasks in the same dataset or for the same task in similar datasets.Off-the-shelf CNN features have capitalized on this idea to promote theirnetworks as best transferable and most general and are used in a cavaliermanner in day-to-day computer vision tasks. It is curious that while the filters learned by these CNNs are related to theatomic structures of the images from which they are learnt, all datasets learnsimilar looking low-level filters. With the understanding that a dataset thatcontains many such atomic structures learn general filters and are thereforeuseful to initialize other networks with, we propose a way to analyse andquantify generality among datasets from their accuracies on transferredfilters. We applied this metric on several popular character recognition,natural image and a medical image dataset, and arrived at some interestingconclusions. On further experimentation we also discovered that particularclasses in a dataset themselves are more general than others.
arxiv-18300-263 | Many Languages, One Parser | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01595v3.pdf | author:Waleed Ammar, George Mulcaire, Miguel Ballesteros, Chris Dyer, Noah A. Smith category:cs.CL published:2016-02-04 summary:We train one multilingual model for dependency parsing and use it to parsesentences in several languages. The parsing model uses (i) multilingual wordclusters and embeddings; (ii) token-level language information; and (iii)language-specific features (fine-grained POS tags). This input representationenables the parser not only to parse effectively in multiple languages, butalso to generalize across languages based on linguistic universals andtypological similarities, making it more effective to learn from limitedannotations. Our parser's performance compares favorably to strong baselines ina range of data scenarios, including when the target language has a largetreebank, a small treebank, or no treebank for training.

The models learned for taggingentities cannot be expected to perform well when deployed on the web. This isowing to the severe mismatch in the distributions of such entities on the weband in the relatively diminutive training data. In this report, we build up thecase for maximum mean discrepancy for estimation of occurrence statistics ofentities on the web, taking a review of named entity disambiguation techniquesand related concepts along the way.
arxiv-18300-265 | Support Vector Algorithms for Optimizing the Partial Area Under the ROC Curve | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04337v1.pdf | author:Harikrishna Narasimhan, Shivani Agarwal category:cs.LG published:2016-05-13 summary:The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure inmachine learning. Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging fromranking to biometric screening to medicine, performance is measured not interms of the full area under the ROC curve, but in terms of the \emph{partial}area under the ROC curve between two false positive rates. In this paper, wedevelop support vector algorithms for directly optimizing the partial AUCbetween any two false positive rates. Our methods are based on minimizing asuitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error. In the case ofthe full AUC, one can readily construct and optimize convex surrogates byexpressing the performance measure as a summation of pairwise terms. Thepartial AUC, on the other hand, does not admit such a simple decomposablestructure, making it more challenging to design and optimize (tight) convexsurrogates for this measure. Our approach builds on the structural SVM framework of Joachims (2005) todesign convex surrogates for partial AUC, and solves the resulting optimizationproblem using a cutting plane solver. Unlike the full AUC, where thecombinatorial optimization needed in each iteration of the cutting plane solvercan be decomposed and solved efficiently, the corresponding problem for thepartial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our main contributions is apolynomial time algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problemassociated with partial AUC. We also develop an approach for optimizing atighter non-convex hinge loss based surrogate for the partial AUC usingdifference-of-convex programming. Our experiments on a variety of real-worldand benchmark tasks confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.

In the literature, a significant amount ofattention has been focused on developing dynamical models for reciprocalprocesses. In this paper, we provide a probabilistic graphical model forreciprocal processes. This leads to a principled solution of the smoothingproblem via message passing algorithms. For the finite state space case,convergence analysis is revisited via the Hilbert metric.

We propose to tackle this problem from theperspective of manifold learning. Our main idea is to align the semantic spacethat is derived from external information to the model space that concernsitself with recognizing visual features. To this end, we introduce a set of"phantom" object classes whose coordinates live in both the semantic space andthe model space. Serving as bases in a dictionary, they can be optimized fromlabeled data such that the synthesized real object classifiers achieve optimaldiscriminative performance. We demonstrate superior accuracy of our approachover the state of the art on four benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning,including the full ImageNet Fall 2011 dataset with more than 20,000 unseenclasses.

The TLEprovides manually annotated POS tags and Universal Dependency (UD) trees for5,124 sentences from the Cambridge First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus.The UD annotations are tied to a pre-existing error annotation of the FCE,whereby full syntactic analyses are provided for both the original and errorcorrected versions of each sentence. Further on, we delineate ESL annotationguidelines that allow for consistent syntactic treatment of ungrammaticalEnglish. Finally, we benchmark POS tagging and dependency parsing performanceon the TLE dataset and measure the effect of grammatical errors on parsingaccuracy. We envision the treebank to support a wide range of linguistic andcomputational research on second language acquisition as well as automaticprocessing of ungrammatical language.

This problem is relevant to the field ofmarketing, where treatments may correspond to different ways of selling aproduct. It is similarly relevant to the field of public policy, wheretreatments may correspond to specific government programs. And finally,personalized medicine is a field wholly devoted to understanding whichsubgroups of individuals will benefit from particular medical treatments. Wepresent a computationally fast tree-based method, ABtree, for treatment effectdifferentiation. Unlike other methods, ABtree specifically produces decisionrules for optimal treatment assignment on a per-individual basis. The treatmentchoices are selected for maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binaryoutcome, conditional on a set of covariates. In this poster, we present themethodology on tree growth and pruning, and show performance results whenapplied to simulated data as well as real data.
arxiv-18300-270 | An Empirical Study and Analysis of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning for Object Recognition in the Wild | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04253v1.pdf | author:Wei-Lun Chao, Soravit Changpinyo, Boqing Gong, Fei Sha category:cs.CV published:2016-05-13 summary:We investigate the problem of generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL). GZSLrelaxes the unrealistic assumption in conventional ZSL that test data belongonly to unseen novel classes. In GZSL, test data might also come from seenclasses and the labeling space is the union of both types of classes. We showempirically that a straightforward application of the classifiers provided byexisting ZSL approaches does not perform well in the setting of GZSL. Motivatedby this, we propose a surprisingly simple but effective method to adapt ZSLapproaches for GZSL. The main idea is to introduce a calibration factor tocalibrate the classifiers for both seen and unseen classes so as to balance twoconflicting forces: recognizing data from seen classes and those from unseenones. We develop a new performance metric called the Area Under Seen-Unseenaccuracy Curve to characterize this tradeoff. We demonstrate the utility ofthis metric by analyzing existing ZSL approaches applied to the generalizedsetting. Extensive empirical studies reveal strengths and weaknesses of thoseapproaches on three well-studied benchmark datasets, including the large-scaleImageNet Full 2011 with 21,000 unseen categories. We complement our comparativestudies in learning methods by further establishing an upper-bound on theperformance limit of GZSL. There, our idea is to use class-representativevisual features as the idealized semantic embeddings. We show that there is alarge gap between the performance of existing approaches and the performancelimit, suggesting that improving the quality of class semantic embeddings isvital to improving zero-shot learning.

Despitethe increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from biology tosmart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains challenging, as theseare continuous time, discrete state systems with potentially infinitestate-space. Here we propose a novel efficient algorithm for joint state /parameter posterior sampling in population Markov Jump processes. We introducea class of pseudo-marginal sampling algorithms based on a random truncationmethod which enables a principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensiveevaluation on a number of benchmark models shows that this approach achievesconsiderable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining accuracyand fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic biology data setshowing the potential for practical usefulness of our work.

However, the separation between reflected andfluoresced components is difficult, because it is impossible to distinguishreflected and fluoresced photons without controlling the illuminant spectrum.We show how to jointly estimate the reflectance and fluorescence from a singleset of images acquired under multiple illuminants. We present a framework basedon a linear approximation to the physical equations describing image formationin terms of surface spectral reflectance and fluorescence due to multiplefluorophores. We relax the non-convex, inverse estimation problem in order tojointly estimate the reflectance and fluorescence properties in a singleoptimization step and we use the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) approach to efficiently find a solution. We provide a softwareimplementation of the solver for our method and prior methods. We evaluate theaccuracy and reliability of the method using both simulations and experimentaldata. To acquire data to test the methods, we built a custom imaging systemusing a monochrome camera, a filter wheel with bandpass transmissive filtersand a small number of light emitting diodes. We compared the system andalgorithm performance with the ground truth as well as with prior methods. Ourapproach produces lower errors compared to earlier algorithms.

This tool for itsdescription in turn requires other large databases (dictionaries, grammarsetc.). Nowadays, the notion of database is associated with computer processingand computer memory. However, a natural language resides also in human brainsand functions in human communication, from interpersonal to intergenerationalone. We discuss in this survey/research paper mathematical, in particulargeometric, constructions, which help to bridge these two worlds. In particular,in this paper we consider the Vector Space Model of semantics based onfrequency matrices, as used in Natural Language Processing. We investigateunderlying geometries, formulated in terms of Grassmannians, projective spaces,and flag varieties. We formulate the relation between vector space models andsemantic spaces based on semic axes in terms of projectability of subvarietiesin Grassmannians and projective spaces. We interpret Latent Semantics as ageometric flow on Grassmannians. We also discuss how to formulate G\"ardenfors'notion of "meeting of minds" in our geometric setting.

Experimental results show that our modeloutperforms existing sentence encoding-based approaches by a large margin.

While therehave been many successes for BO in low dimensions, scaling it to highdimensions has been notoriously difficult. Existing literature on the topic areunder very restrictive settings. In this paper, we identify two key challengesin this endeavour. We tackle these challenges by assuming an additive structurefor the function. This setting is substantially more expressive and contains aricher class of functions than previous work. We prove that, for additivefunctions the regret has only linear dependence on $D$ even though the functiondepends on all $D$ dimensions. We also demonstrate several other statisticaland computational benefits in our framework. Via synthetic examples, ascientific simulation and a face detection problem we demonstrate that ourmethod outperforms naive BO on additive functions and on several examples wherethe function is not additive.
arxiv-18300-279 | Learning scale-variant and scale-invariant features for deep image classification | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01255v2.pdf | author:Nanne van Noord, Eric Postma category:cs.CV published:2016-02-03 summary:Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require large image corpora to betrained on classification tasks. The variation in image resolutions, sizes ofobjects and patterns depicted, and image scales, hampers CNN training andperformance, because the task-relevant information varies over spatial scales.Previous work attempting to deal with such scale variations focused onencouraging scale-invariant CNN representations. However, scale-invariantrepresentations are incomplete representations of images, because imagescontain scale-variant information as well. This paper addresses the combineddevelopment of scale-invariant and scale-variant representations. We propose amulti- scale CNN method to encourage the recognition of both types of featuresand evaluate it on a challenging image classification task involvingtask-relevant characteristics at multiple scales. The results show that ourmulti-scale CNN outperforms single-scale CNN. This leads to the conclusion thatencouraging the combined development of a scale-invariant and scale-variantrepresentation in CNNs is beneficial to image recognition performance.
arxiv-18300-280 | Deep Gate Recurrent Neural Network | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02910v3.pdf | author:Yuan Gao, Dorota Glowacka category:cs.NE published:2016-04-11 summary:This paper introduces two recurrent neural network structures called SimpleGated Unit (SGU) and Deep Simple Gated Unit (DSGU), which are generalstructures for learning long term dependencies. Compared to traditional LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both structuresrequire fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classificationtasks. Unlike GRU and LSTM, which require more than one gates to controlinformation flow in the network, SGU and DSGU only use one multiplicative gateto control the flow of information. We show that this difference can acceleratethe learning speed in tasks that require long dependency information. We alsoshow that DSGU is more numerically stable than SGU. In addition, we alsopropose a standard way of representing inner structure of RNN called RNNConventional Graph (RCG), which helps analyzing the relationship between inputunits and hidden units of RNN.
arxiv-18300-281 | Clustering with Missing Features: A Penalized Dissimilarity Measure based approach | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06602v2.pdf | author:Shounak Datta, Supritam Bhattacharjee, Swagatam Das category:cs.LG 62H30 published:2016-04-22 summary:Many real-world clustering problems are plagued by incomplete datacharacterized by missing or absent features for some or all of the datainstances. Traditional clustering methods cannot be directly applied to suchdata without preprocessing by imputation or marginalization techniques. In thisarticle, we put forth the concept of Penalized Dissimilarity Measures whichestimate the actual distance between two data points (the distance between themif they were to be fully observed) by adding a penalty to the distance due tothe observed features common to both the instances. We then propose such adissimilarity measure called the Feature Weighted Penalty based Dissimilarity(FWPD) measure. Using the proposed dissimilarity measure, we also modify thetraditional k-means clustering algorithm and the standard hierarchicalagglomerative clustering techniques so as to make them directly applicable todatasets with missing features. We present time complexity analyses for thesenew techniques and also present a detailed analysis showing that the new FWPDbased k-means algorithm converges to a local optimum within a finite number ofiterations. We have also conducted extensive experiments on various benchmarkdatasets showing that the proposed clustering techniques have generally betterresults compared to some of the popular imputation methods which are commonlyused to handle such incomplete data. We have appended a possible extension ofthe proposed dissimilarity measure to the case of absent features (where theunobserved features are known to be non-existent).
arxiv-18300-282 | Structured Receptive Fields in CNNs | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02971v2.pdf | author:Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, Jan van Gemert, Zhongyu Lou, Arnold W. M. Smeulders category:cs.CV published:2016-05-10 summary:Learning powerful feature representations with CNNs is hard when trainingdata are limited. Pre-training is one way to overcome this, but it requireslarge datasets sufficiently similar to the target domain. Another option is todesign priors into the model, which can range from tuned hyperparameters tofully engineered representations like Scattering Networks. We combine theseideas into structured receptive field networks, a model which has a fixedfilter basis and yet retains the flexibility of CNNs. This flexibility isachieved by expressing receptive fields in CNNs as a weighted sum over a fixedbasis which is similar in spirit to Scattering Networks. The key difference isthat we learn arbitrary effective filter sets from the basis rather thanmodeling the filters. This approach explicitly connects classical multiscaleimage analysis with general CNNs. With structured receptive field networks, weimprove considerably over unstructured CNNs for small and medium datasetscenarios as well as over Scattering for large datasets. We validate ourfindings on ILSVRC2012, Cifar-10, Cifar-100 and MNIST. As a realistic smalldataset example, we show state-of-the-art classification results on popular 3DMRI brain-disease datasets where pre-training is difficult due to a lack oflarge public datasets in a similar domain.
arxiv-18300-283 | Barzilai-Borwein Step Size for Stochastic Gradient Descent | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04131v1.pdf | author:Conghui Tan, Shiqian Ma, Yu-Hong Dai, Yuqiu Qian category:math.OC cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-05-13 summary:One of the major issues in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods is howto choose an appropriate step size while running the algorithm. Since thetraditional line search technique does not apply for stochastic optimizationalgorithms, the common practice in SGD is either to use a diminishing stepsize, or to tune a fixed step size by hand. Apparently, these two approachescan be time consuming in practice. In this paper, we propose to use theBarzilai-Borwein (BB) method to automatically compute step sizes for SGD andits variant: stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) method, which leads totwo algorithms: SGD-BB and SVRG-BB. We prove that SVRG-BB converges linearlyfor strongly convex objective function. As a by-product, we prove the linearconvergence result of SVRG with Option I proposed in [10], whose convergenceresult has been missing in the literature. Numerical experiments on standarddata sets show that the performance of SGD-BB and SVRG-BB is comparable to andsometimes even better than SGD and SVRG with best-tuned step sizes, and issuperior to some advanced SGD variants.

Detecting Social Interactions in Egocentric Photo-streams | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04129v1.pdf | author:Maedeh Aghaei, Mariella Dimiccoli, Petia Radeva category:cs.CV published:2016-05-13 summary:Given a user wearing a low frame rate wearable camera during a day, this workaims to automatically detect the moments when the user gets engaged into asocial interaction solely by reviewing the automatically captured photos by theworn camera. The proposed method, inspired by the sociological concept ofF-formation, exploits distance and orientation of the appearing individuals-with respect to the user- in the scene from a bird-view perspective. As aresult, the interaction pattern over the sequence can be understood as atwo-dimensional time series that corresponds to the temporal evolution of thedistance and orientation features over time. A Long-Short Term Memory-basedRecurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each time series.Experimental evaluation over a dataset of 30.000 images has shown promisingresults on the proposed method for social interaction detection in egocentricphoto-streams.

We argue that as long as possible world semantics is left out,one can compute the semantic representation(s) of a given statement, includingaspects of lexical meaning. We also discuss the algorithmic complexity of thisprocess.

The main barrier to further uptake of thispowerful tool rests in the computational costs associated with the matriceswhich arise when dealing with large data sets. Here, we derive some simpleresults which we have found useful for speeding up the learning stage in theGPR algorithm, and especially for performing Bayesian model comparison betweendifferent covariance functions. We apply our techniques to both synthetic andreal data and quantify the speed-up relative to using nested sampling tonumerically evaluate model evidences.

It is claimed that, ifthese criteria are satisfied, then the aggregate decisions made by a group willoften be better than those of its individual members. Inspired by this concept,we present a novel feedback framework for the cluster ensemble problem, whichwe call Wisdom of Crowds Cluster Ensemble (WOCCE). Although many conventionalcluster ensemble methods focusing on diversity have recently been proposed,WOCCE analyzes the conditions necessary for a crowd to exhibit this collectivewisdom. These include decentralization criteria for generating primary results,independence criteria for the base algorithms, and diversity criteria for theensemble members. We suggest appropriate procedures for evaluating thesemeasures, and propose a new measure to assess the diversity. We evaluate theperformance of WOCCE against some other traditional base algorithms as well asstate-of-the-art ensemble methods. The results demonstrate the efficiency ofWOCCE's aggregate decision-making compared to other algorithms.

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlledmachines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, andunderstand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm andintention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need anempathy module in them which can extract emotions from human speech andbehavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research onempathetic robots is still in the early stage, we described our approach usingsignal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learningalgorithms to make robots that can "understand" human emotion. We propose Zarathe Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a softwarebased virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself onthe screen. She will get "smarter" and more empathetic through its deeplearning algorithms, and by gathering more data and learning from it. In thispaper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion andsentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore thefuture direction of android development and how it can help improve people'slives.

Nevertheless, most such people are sedentary. Smartphonescreate new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physicalactivity goals, through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled withpersonalized feedback. We provided 27 sedentary diabetes type 2 patients with a smartphone-basedpedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent SMSmessages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week.Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithmwhich optimized messages to improve each participant's compliance with theactivity regimen. The RL algorithm was compared to a static policy for sendingmessages and to weekly reminders. Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the RLalgorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, while thecontrol group patients did not. Patients assigned to the RL algorithm groupexperienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared tocontrol policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in bloodglucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting whichmessages would lead participants to exercise. Our results suggest that a mobile phone application coupled with a learningalgorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. As a learningalgorithm is automated, and delivers personalized messages, it could be used inlarge populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control.Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coachingof humans may have a positive impact.
arxiv-18300-290 | Fast Semantic Image Segmentation with High Order Context and Guided Filtering | http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04068v1.pdf | author:Falong Shen, Gang Zeng category:cs.CV published:2016-05-13 summary:This paper describes a fast and accurate semantic image segmentation approachthat encodes not only the discriminative features from deep neural networks,but also the high-order context compatibility among adjacent objects as well aslow level image features. We formulate the underlying problem as theconditional random field that embeds local feature extraction, clique potentialconstruction, and guided filtering within the same framework, and provide anefficient coarse-to-fine solver. At the coarse level, we combine local featurerepresentation and context interaction using a deep convolutional network, anddirectly learn the interaction from high order cliques with a message passingroutine, avoiding time-consuming explicit graph inference for joint probabilitydistribution. At the fine level, we introduce a guided filtering interpretationfor the mean field algorithm, and achieve accurate object boundaries with 100+faster than classic learning methods. The two parts are connected and jointlytrained in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012dataset have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms thestate-of-the-art, and that it achieves the rank 1 performance at the time ofsubmission, both of which prove the effectiveness of this unified framework forsemantic image segmentation.

One of the ways of improving yield is through discovery of the rootcausal factors affecting yield. We propose the use of data-driven interpretablecausal models to identify key factors affecting yield. We focus on factors thatare measured in different stages of production and testing in the manufacturingcycle of a product. We apply causal structure learning techniques on real datacollected from this line. Specifically, the goal of this work is to learninterpretable causal models from observational data produced by manufacturinglines. Emphasis has been given to the interpretability of the models to make themactionable in the field of manufacturing. We highlight the challenges presentedby assembly line data and propose ways to alleviate them.We also identifyunique characteristics of data originating from assembly lines and how toleverage them in order to improve causal discovery. Standard evaluationtechniques for causal structure learning shows that the learned causal modelsseem to closely represent the underlying latent causal relationship betweendifferent factors in the production process. These results were also validatedby manufacturing domain experts who found them promising. This workdemonstrates how data mining and knowledge discovery can be used for root causeanalysis in the domain of manufacturing and connected industry.

HRC are a class of finite-state randomprocess models that generalise the familiar hidden Markov chains (HMC). HRC areable to model the "intention" of a target to proceed from a given origin to adestination, behaviour which cannot be properly captured by a HMC. WhileBayesian estimation problems for HRC have previously been studied, this paperfocusses principally on the problem of track extraction, of which the primarytask is confirming target existence in a set of detections obtained fromthresholding sensor measurements. Simulation examples are presented which showthat the additional model information contained in a HRC improves detectionperformance when compared to HMC models.

Conventional approaches to this problem usually involvestwo steps: i) projecting samples from different domains into a common space,and ii) computing (dis-)similarity in this space based on a certain distance.In this paper, we present a novel pairwise similarity measure that advancesexisting models by i) expanding traditional linear projections into affinetransformations and ii) fusing affine Mahalanobis distance and Cosinesimilarity by a data-driven combination. Moreover, we unify our similaritymeasure with feature representation learning via deep convolutional neuralnetworks. Specifically, we incorporate the similarity measure matrix into thedeep architecture, enabling an end-to-end way of model optimization. Weextensively evaluate our generalized similarity model in several challengingcross-domain matching tasks: person re-identification under different views andface verification over different modalities (i.e., faces from still images andvideos, older and younger faces, and sketch and photo portraits). Theexperimental results demonstrate superior performance of our model over otherstate-of-the-art methods.

Tsang, Zheng Qin, Rick Siow Mong Goh category:cs.LG stat.ML published:2016-05-13 summary:Most existing learning to hash methods assume that there are sufficient data,either labeled or unlabeled, on the domain of interest (i.e., the targetdomain) for training. However, this assumption cannot be satisfied in somereal-world applications. To address this data sparsity issue in hashing,inspired by transfer learning, we propose a new framework named TransferHashing with Privileged Information (THPI). Specifically, we extend thestandard learning to hash method, Iterative Quantization (ITQ), in a transferlearning manner, namely ITQ+. In ITQ+, a new slack function is learned fromauxiliary data to approximate the quantization error in ITQ. We developed analternating optimization approach to solve the resultant optimization problemfor ITQ+. We further extend ITQ+ to LapITQ+ by utilizing the geometry structureamong the auxiliary data for learning more precise binary codes in the targetdomain. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets verify theeffectiveness of our proposed approaches through comparisons with severalstate-of-the-art baselines.

This generalizesexisting work on sparse tensor decomposition and penalized matrixdecompositions, in a manner parallel to the generalized lasso for regressionand smoothing problems. Our approach presents many nontrivial challenges at theintersection of modeling and computation, which are studied in detail. Anefficient coordinate-wise optimization algorithm for (PTD) is presented, andits convergence properties are characterized. The method is applied both tosimulated data and real data on flu hospitalizations in Texas.

Concretely, we willwork with context-free grammars \`{a} la Chomsky, but Combinatory CategorialGrammar (CCG) and dependency grammars could also be used. We begin by dividingwords in the corpus according to three semantic functions: (i) object words,directly modelled in the semantic space; (ii) modifier words, acting onindividual object words; (iii) interaction words, connecting the meaning ofdistinct object words. We then consider the compact closed symmetric monoidalcategory of $R$-semimodules over an involutive commutative semiring $R$, and wemodel object words as vectors in a free $R$-semimodule $\mathcal{H}$,constructed from the corpus. Based on the grammatical structure annotating thecorpus, we use Frobenius algebras to model modifier words as unary operators on$\mathcal{H}$, and interaction words as binary operators on $\mathcal{H}$. Wediscuss some possible future extensions and improvements of this model.
