ud902 | Learn Swift Programming Syntax - From Optionals to Closure Expressions | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud902 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Gabrielle Miller-Messner description:Swift is a language created by Apple specifically for iOS and OS X development. It’s fast, concise, and comes with tools  which make it easier than ever to visualize one's code. This course focuses on the syntax of the Swift programming language. By the end of the course, students should be able to apply Swift essentials to building iOS apps and employ Swift's more unique elements, like optional types and switch statements, with confidence.
ud788 | UIKit Fundamentals - Learn the iOS User Interface Library | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud788 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Gabrielle Miller-Messner description:In this course, you will build a series of simple apps to become more comfortable with the UIKit framework and master its most widely used components. This framework constitutes the building blocks of the user interface for all iOS apps, and is crucial for any iOS Developer to be intimately familiar with.
ud421 | iOS Networking with Swift - Web Services, APIs, and JSON | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud421 | available:yes level:advanced instructors:Jarrod Parkes description:In this course, you’ll learn how to incorporate networking into your apps, so they can access data from around the world. You’ll learn how to harness the power of APIs to display images and retrieve movie data. At the end of the course, you’ll build the “On the Map” app which allows you to share interesting links, projects, or other information with fellow Udacity students.
ud576 | Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) - Perform Asynchronous Operations in iOS | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud576 | available:yes level: instructor description:Many times your apps need to run lengthy operations in the background, like downloading data, but you don't want these operations to interfere with your UI.Apple's GCD (long form: Grand Central Dispatch) framework allows you to create asynchronous apps for iOS, ensuring smooth a smooth user experience in situations like the one mentioned above.
ud325 | iOS Persistence and Core Data - Learn the top 3 technologies to store an | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud325 | available:yes level:advanced instructor description:Persisting data is a core skill for any iOS developer. This course will teach you three techniques for storing data to your device’s hard drive: NSUserPreferences for small amounts of data, the Sandbox for files and Core Data when you have to play in the Big Leagues!
ud1009 | Objective-C for Swift Developers | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud1009 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Gabrielle Miller-Messner description:This course is designed to teach students how to understand and identify the differences between the Objective-C and Swift programming languages, and especially, how to rewrite from the former to the latter. Understanding communications between the two languages—called "interoperability"—is becoming more and more important for developers, particularly as we prepare for the arrival of Swift 3.0. In the course, students will write classes and add functionality to classes by writing and calling methods. After learning some basic Objective-C syntax, students will examine and break down an app written in Objective-C and rewrite it in Swift. The course will conclude with a review of and practice with the most common challenges for interoperability between Objective-C and Swift.
ud774 | Xcode Debugging - Print Statements, Breakpoints, and LLDB | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud774 | available:yes level:advanced instructors:Jarrod Parkes description:"If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."<br> *Edsger W. Dijkstra*Debugging is yin to programming's yang; you can't have one without the other. However, finding bugs in programs can be an incredibly frustrating and demotivating process for developers. This course will teach you a variety of techniques to help make debugging your code easier.
